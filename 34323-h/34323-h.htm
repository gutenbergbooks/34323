style='font-size:14.0pt'>THE SAMURAI STRATEGY</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><br>
<i>”A financial thriller right out of the headlines.”  </i>Adam Smith</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2><br>
A high-finance, high-tech thriller that correctly predicted the 1987 stock
market crash. It was the first fictional treatment of a major international
concern of the Eighties. Set in locales as diverse as Wall Street and the
offices of Japan's powerful Trade Ministry, THE SAMURAI STRATEGY describes a
scenario of murder, worldwide currency manipulation, a revival of Japan's
smoldering nationalism, and is set against a background of a new high-tech
computer milieu. Matthew Walton, a freelance corporate 'takeover' lawyer is
hired by a mysterious Japanese industrialist to purchase a New York office
building and begin a massive 'hedging' in the financial markets. Two weeks later,
off an island in the Inland Sea, divers working for the industrialist's
organization, recover the original Imperial Sword, given to Japan's first
Emperor by the Sun Goddess, Japan's 'Excalibur', and lost in a sea battle in
1185. He forms an '800-Year Fund' and billions of yen flow to his fingertips.
He then dumps all the Treasuries Japan had acquired and devastates the American
economy.<br>
<br>
As the story rushes to its stunning conclusion, Matt Walton goes to Japan and
determines that the 'Imperial Sword' is, in fact an unusual antique he once
owned himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>New York</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
 </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Friday, early September, dusk.
Heading uptown on </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Madison</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Sheets of icy rain washed the
pavement, heralding the onslaught of autumn and the miserable winter to come.
The city was poised for its cruelest months, that twilight of the spirit when
strangers arm-wrestle for taxis, nobody has time to hold a door, and you
cherish every fleeting human kindness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Bring on the blizzards, the holiday madness. This winter I
was planning something long overdue. To treat my daughter Amy, the Madame Curie
of her ninth grade, to a real vacation. Just us. We'd leave at Thanksgiving and
stay gone through the Christmas break. She got to live with me three months a
year, and December was by God going to be one of the months. School? She'd
already skipped a year; maybe she was a little too fast-track for thirteen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since Joanna, my ex, had already lined up her own holiday
excursion (Amy the spy claimed it was with some divorced Tishman VP), she
hadn't bothered inventing the usual roadblocks. Clear sailing. We'd open the
house down in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>St. Croix</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and spend a month getting
reacquainted. Work on the tan and some postgraduate snorkeling, a strategic
move while I still enjoyed a small sliver of her attention, before a certain
&quot;totally terrific&quot; skateboard virtuoso finally got around to noticing
her. Only a couple of jobs needed finishing, but they'd be wrapped up with
weeks to spare.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That night, in truth, had its moments of nostalgia. The
destination was Sotheby's auction house, a place where Matthew Walton was
greeted by name at the cashier's window. Home away from home for obsessive
collectors. I leaned back</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>against the
vinyl seat of the Checker, letting the rhythm of the streetlight halos glimmer
past, and reflected on all those happy nights I'd made the trek with Joanna.
She'd had no real interest in my collecting hobby, Japanese samurai swords and
armor, but she was always a decent sport about it. Besides, she had her own
passions. While I was agonizing over long blades and short blades, she'd sneak
off and browse for something French and nineteenth century and expensive. Fact
is, I'd usually plan ahead and have something of my own on the block just to
pay for that little sketch, or print, she suddenly had to have. Out of habit
I'd even shipped up a couple of mistakes for the auction this evening (a hand
axe and a lacquered-metal face guard).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Though tonight's sale had only a few odd items in my
specialty, the slim offerings actually suited the occasion. It left the evening
open, time for the real agenda—getting things rolling with a new client who'd
inexplicably handed me a job as simple as it was strange.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The man, name of Matsuo Noda, had rung all the way from Japan
Friday before last, introduced himself in generalities, then declared he had a
pressing legal matter requiring both speed and confidentiality. Inquiries had
led him to me. Would I have time to help him locate an office building to buy?
He claimed he was head of a Kyoto consulting outfit that called itself Nippon,
Inc., and he was looking for something in midtown, seventy-million range.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Honestly I couldn't quite believe he was serious at first.
Why this job (just a little legwork, really) for somebody he'd never even met?
I could swing it, sure, but now that Japanese investors were snapping up U.S.
property right and left, who needed some ex-Texan turned New York lawyer
knocking around? There was no rational reason to engage a corporate attorney.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Out of curiosity, why aren't you working through one of
the Tokyo firms here in New York, say, Hiro Real Estate or KG Land? Surely they
could—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton,&quot; he interrupted smoothly but firmly,
&quot;allow me to say I have my reasons. May I remind you I stressed confidentiality.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Merely asking.&quot; I took a deep breath. The
connection was distorted, a high-pitched hum in the background, as though he
wasn't using commercial phone lines. &quot;If you want, I can look around and
see what's on the market . . . and in the meantime how about sending along a
prospectus, just for the file?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Assuredly,&quot; he said, &quot;and I do look forward
to working with you.&quot; After a few more polite nothings, he abruptly closed
out the call.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Peculiar. That wasn't how the Japanese road show usually did
business. From what I'd seen, Tokyo invests very cautiously and deliberately,
sometimes &quot;researching&quot; a deal half to death. I momentarily wondered
if it wasn't just one of the jokers from my old partnership pulling my leg.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was real enough. A brochure arrived by overnight air,
bound in leather, with a flowery covering letter. Two problems: most of the
thing was in his native tongue, and what I could read didn't tip his hand. From
the looks of its public disclosures, Nippon, Inc. was merely some kind of money
manager for Japanese investment banks; it had almost no assets of its own. All
I could find listed were a few million dollars, lunch money for a Japanese
outfit, mostly cash parked in some short-term Euroyen paper. That, and a head
office in Kyoto, was the sum of it. What's more, Noda only worked with Japanese
banks and firms. No foreign clients.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So why did this man suddenly require space in New York? An
entire building. I honestly couldn't figure it. On the other hand, with any
luck the whole deal probably could be put together with a few phone calls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By way of introduction, let me say that I worked,
technically, as a straightforward attorney-at-law. I say
&quot;technically&quot; because I was, in fact, a freelance defensive back in
the corporate takeover game, which these days is anything but straight. You'd
have to go back to the roaring twenties to find so many creative screw-jobs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Some people are drawn to power; guess I'm more attracted to
the idea of occasionally whittling it down to size. So when some hotshot raider
found a happy little company whose breakup value was worth more than the
current stock price, then decided to move in and grab it, loot the assets, and
sell off the pieces—one of the players apt to end up downfield was Matt Walton.
For reasons that go a long way back, I liked to break up the running patterns
of the fast-buck artists. It's a game where you win some and lose some. The
trick is to try and beat the odds, and I suppose I'd had my share of luck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Give you a quick example. Back in the spring, a midsize
cosmetics outfit called me in as part of their reinforcements to fight an
avaricious rape, better known as a hostile takeover, by one of their biggest
competitors. After looking over the balance sheet and shares outstanding, I
suggested they divest a couple of unpromising consumer divisions—namely a
&quot;male fragrance&quot; line that made you smell like a kid leaving the
barbershop, and a &quot;feminine hygiene&quot; product that could have been a
patent infringement on Lysol—and use the proceeds to buy back their own common
shares. We also threw together a &quot;poison pill&quot; that would have
practically had them owning anybody who acquired more than twenty percent of
their stock. Our move scared hell out of the circling vultures and reinforced
my reputation on the Street (unduly harsh, I thought) as a give-no-quarter son
of a bitch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Another fact worth mentioning is that I worked without
benefit of a real office; after selling off my piece of the law partnership, I
operated out of my place downtown, with a telephone and a couple of computers.
A kindly gray-haired dynamo by the name of Emma Epstein, who had a rent-
controlled apartment down the block, dropped by afternoons and handled
correspondence, filing, matrimonial advice, and the occasional pot of medicinal
chicken soup. The only other member of my staff was a shaggy sheepdog named
Benjamin, who served as security chief, periodically sweeping the back garden
for the neighbor's cat. That was it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Oh, yes, one other item. Crucial, as it turned out. I'd
always been a collector of something—once it was antique spurs, for
chrissake—but about ten years earlier I'd started to get interested in things
Japanese and ended up going a little overboard about old swords and such.
Joanna's unscheduled departure managed to burn out a lot of my circuits, and
what had been merely an obsession grew into something a little crazy. For a
year or so I became, in my own mind at least, a sort of American <i>ronin</i>,
a wandering samurai.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>You see, the Japanese warriors had a code that said
you ought to live every moment in full awareness of your own mortality. When
you adopt this existential outlook, so they claimed, all regrets, emotions,
complaints, can be seen as an indulgence. You're ready to meet life head-on, to
risk everything at a moment's notice. That's the only way you ever discover who
you really are, and it's supposed to make you marvelously detached.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Almost enough to make you forget how your raven-haired,
brilliant, sexy mate packed it in one New Year's Eve twenty</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>months past
. . . when you called late from the office, again . . . after declaring that
that was the goddam last straw and apparently the only thing you could find
worthy of undivided attention came printed on goddam computer paper and she was
goddam sick of it—which she demonstrated the next day by slamming the door on
her way out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Add to which, she used my momentary disorientation to get
custody of Amy. So while I was battling corporate Goliaths, I let her walk off
with the only thing I would have given my life for. The more time went by, the
more I wanted to kick myself. Alex Katz (of Walton, Halliday, and Katz—now
minus the Walton) read the custody agreement the day after I signed it, sighed,
glared over his smudgy half-lenses, and announced that this kind of
unconditional surrender should only be signed on the decks of battleships. What
did he have, a law partner or a fucking schlemiel?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was right, for all the wrong reasons. Not long after, I
cashed in my piece of the firm and went independent. Win or lose, it's best to
sort things out on your own. I was then forty- three, six one, and weighed in
at an even one eighty. There were a few lines on the face and several more on
the psyche, but the sandy hair was mostly intact, and I could still swim a
couple of miles if absolutely essential. Maybe there was still time for a new
start. Part of that therapy was going to be our trip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Perhaps I should also add that I'd had a brief
&quot;rebound&quot; fling, for what it was worth. The lady was Donna Austen, a
name you'll recognize as belonging to that irrepressibly cheerful
&quot;Personalities!&quot; host on what Channel Eight likes to term its Evening
News. She'd called about a segment on the subject of the cosmetics company
takeover, then very much in the local press, and I'd said fine. She ended up
downtown, and soon thereafter we became an item. She was the closest I'd had to
a girlfriend, and at that it was mostly an on-again, off-again thing—which
terminated in an event reminiscent of the Hindenburg’s last flight. In the
aftermath I went back to chatting with Amy every day on the phone, putting
together stock buyback packages, and collecting Japanese swords.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Anyway, while the cab waited for a light, worn-out wipers
squeaking, I fumbled around in my coat pocket and extracted the <i>meishi</i>,
the business card, one side in English, the other Japanese, that had been
included with Noda's letter. He'd</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>personalized
it with a handwritten note on the side with English print. Now, I'd kept track
of the new Japanese investment heavies in town—Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko, Sumitomo—since
you never know when a corporation might need some fast liquidity. They were
starting to play hardball, and these days (with all that cheap money back home)
they would underbid a nine-figure financing deal before Drexel Burnham could
spell &quot;junk bond.&quot; But Nippon, Inc.? Never heard of the outfit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, I thought, you'll know the story soon enough. The
driver had just hung a right on Fifty-seventh and was headed east toward York
Avenue. I'd called that afternoon to lower the reserve on one of my lots and
had been told that because of some union squabble the preview would continue
till just before the sale, now scheduled to kick off at eight-thirty. It wasn't
quite seven yet, so we would have at least an hour to run through my list of
prospective buildings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the cab pulled up next to the chaste glass awning, I took
a deep breath, shoved a ten through the Plexiglas panel between the seats, and
stepped out. While the battered Checker (lamented remnant of a vanishing
species) squealed into the dark, I unbuttoned my overcoat and headed up the
steps. A few grim-faced patrons milled here and there in the lobby, but nobody
looked familiar. There was even a new girl at the desk by the stairs, ash blond
and tasteful smoked pearls, pure Bryn Mawr art history. A class act, Sotheby's.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It appeared that most of the Japanese crowd was already
upstairs, undoubtedly meditating on their bids with the meticulous precision of
the Orient. I was headed up the wide, granite steps myself when I decided to
check out the downstairs one last time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hold on, could be there's a possibility. Waiting over by the
coat check, thumbing the catalog, was a distinguished-looking guy, retirement
age, wearing a light, charcoal suit. Italian. Unlike the usual Japanese
businessmen, he clearly didn't assume he had to dress like an undertaker and
keep a low profile. No, probably just some Mitsubishi board member thinking to
diversify his portfolio with a few <i>objets d'art</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Abruptly he glanced up, smiled, and headed my way. I realized
I'd been recognized.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton, how good of you to come.&quot; After a
quick bow he produced his card, a formality that totally ignored the fact he'd
already sent me one. As convention required, I held it in my left hand and
studied it anew while I accepted his hearty American handshake. &quot;It's a
pleasure to meet you. At last.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At last?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I let that puzzler pass and handed over a card of my own,
which he held politely throughout our opening ritual, then pocketed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda had a mane of silver hair sculptured around a lean, tan
face, and he looked to be somewhere between sixty and seventy. Though his dark
eyes were caught in a web of wrinkles that bespoke his years, they had a
sparkle of raw energy. He moved with an easy poise, and the initial impression
was that of a man eminently self-possessed. He had that sturdy, no-nonsense
assurance usually reserved for airline pilots. If you had to entrust somebody
with your wife, or your life savings, this man would be your pick.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, my new client's a mover, I told myself. All the same, I
accepted his hand with a vague twinge of misgiving. What was it? Maybe
something about him was a little too precise, too calculated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton, permit me to introduce my personal
consultant.&quot; He laughed, a slight edge beneath the charm, and more
wrinkles shot outward from the corners of his eyes. &quot;I always seek her
approval of major acquisitions, particularly those of the Heian period, her
specialty.&quot; He turned with what seemed obvious pride and gestured toward
the tall Japanese woman standing behind him. I'd been so busy sizing him up I'd
completely failed to notice her. &quot;I must confess she is, in fact, my . . .
niece. I suppose that ages me.&quot; Another smile. &quot;You may possibly be
familiar with her professional name, so perhaps I should use that. May I introduce
Akira Mori.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Who? I stared a second before the face clicked into place.
And the name. They both belonged to a well-known commentator on Tokyo
television. Only one slight problem: her &quot;specialty&quot; had nothing to
do with art.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Hajimemashite</i>. How do you do, Mr. Walton.&quot;
She bowed formally and, I noticed, with all the warmth of an iceberg. No
surprise—I knew her opinion of Americans. She did not bother meeting my eye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked just as I remembered her from the tube. A
knockout. Her hair was pulled back into a chignon, framing that classic oval
face, and her age was anybody's guess, given the ivory skin and granite chin.
She was wearing a bulky something in black and deep ocher by one of the new
Tokyo designers. For some reason I was drawn to her fingernails, long and
bronze. The parts, a mixture of classic and avant-garde, did not seem of a
piece, the kind of detail you didn't notice on the TV. But there was something
more important than her looks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I'd been to Tokyo from time to time for various
reasons, and I'd heard a lot of stories about this lady. Fact is, you didn't
have to be Japanese to know that Akira Mori was easily Japan's most listened-to
money analyst. You've probably seen her yourself in snippets of that weekly
chat show she had on NHK, which used to get picked up by the networks here when
they needed a quick thirty seconds on &quot;Japan This Week&quot; or such. Her
ratings had little to do with the fact she's a looker. She was, talk had it, an
unofficial source for official government monetary policy. Akira Mori always
had a lead on exactly what was afoot, from the Bank of Japan to the Ministry of
Finance, even before the prime minister broke the news.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Miss &quot;Mori,&quot; whoever the hell she was, had some
very well placed friends. Tell you something else, she didn't go out of her way
to find flattering things to say about how Uncle Sam handled his bankbook these
days. Her appearance here made Noda's unorthodox office plans even more
perplexing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We both appreciate your taking time from your schedule
to meet with us.&quot; He bowed again. &quot;We've been looking forward to
having you join us at the sale.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While Akira Mori appeared to busy herself with a catalog,
Noda and I got things going with that standard formality preceding any serious
Japanese professional contact: meaningless chat. It's how they set up their <i>ningen
kankei</i>, their relationship with the other guy, and it's also the way they
fine-tune their <i>honne</i>, their gut feeling about a situation. Any
greenhorn foreigner who skimps on these vital niceties runs the risk of
torpedoing his whole deal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In response to my pro forma inquiries, Matsuo Noda declared
he liked New York, had even lived here for a while once, honestly found it less
hectic than Tokyo, usually stayed these days at the Japanese hotel down on Park
but sometimes picked the Plaza when he needed to be closer to midtown. He
adored La Grenouille and thought La Tulipe overpraised. When I pressed him, he
declared his favorite Japanese place to dine was Nippon, over in the East
Fifties (maybe he merely liked the name, but it was my pick as well).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After he had in turn solicited my own views on Sotheby's, a
couple of the galleries down Madison, and various North Italian eateries, he
suggested we go on upstairs and preview the lots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All the while Miss Mori appeared to ignore us, standing there
like a statue of some Shinto goddess, except for the occasional tug at her dark
hair. Maybe she didn't give a damn about this obligatory small talk, thought it
was old-fashioned. Or possibly she liked the idea of being the only one not to
show a hand. And as Noda led the way up toward the exhibition rooms, she
trailed behind like a dutiful Japanese woman—while we, naturally, continued to
talk of everything except, God forbid, why we were there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the first room we were suddenly in my arena—samurai swords
and battle gear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is your special interest, is it not, Mr.
Walton?&quot; Noda smiled, then turned to admire the row of shining steel <i>tachi</i>,
three-foot-long razors, now being watched over by a trio of nervous guards.
Sotheby's didn't need some amateur Toshiro Mifune accidentally carving up the
clientele. &quot;I understand you have a notable collection yourself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What? What else did he know about me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Easy, Walton. Play the game. I knew what a Japanese would
expect in reply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matter of fact, I've lucked onto a couple of items over
the years.&quot; Then the standard disclaimers. My own painstaking collection
was merely a grab bag of knickknacks, the fumbling mistakes of a dabbler, etc.,
etc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda monitored this culturally correct blarney with satisfaction.
&quot;As it happens, Mr. Walton, I was in Nagoya last year when several of your
pieces were on loan for the show at the Tokugawa Museum. I still recall certain
ones, particularly that fine fifteenth-century katana, attributed to the Mizuno
clan. Unusual steel. No date or mark of the swordsmith, but a remarkable piece
all the same.&quot; A split-second pause. &quot;Your reluctance to part with it
was most understandable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This man had done his homework! Or maybe he'd been the one
who had tried to buy it. The steel was unusual, too heavy on copper. I'd even
had a little metallurgical testing done on it down at Princeton, just to prove
that hunch. But it was no big</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>deal, merely
an oddity that had fallen my way via an estate sale. There was an anonymous
inquiry shortly after the exhibition opened, with an insistent offer, but I'd
turned it down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Poker time. &quot;I was honored. Your figure was more than
generous.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He laughed—bull's-eye. I watched as he glanced back at Miss
Mori, maybe a bit nervously. Then he returned his attention. &quot;Merely a
small gesture for the museum. I felt it should be back in Japanese hands.&quot;
He continued, his voice now sober. &quot;You do understand?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Certainly.&quot; I just stared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good. I see I was right.&quot; He had paused to examine
a large monochrome screen. It was eighteenth century and he inspected it with
only mild interest, then moved on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was still knocked over. Could that be why he'd retained me
as his U.S. legal counsel? Because of some damned antique sword? Okay, I was
already getting the idea Matsuo Noda might be a trifle eccentric, but all the
same . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Interesting.&quot; He was pointing at a long picture,
part of a series locked in a wide glass case. &quot;<i>Honto ni omoshiroi, desu
ne</i>?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Miss Mori was already there. In a voice scarcely
above a whisper she proceeded to give him a rundown of pros and cons. It was
the first time I'd noticed any enthusiasm out of the woman all night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I checked my catalogue. The piece was a Heian hand scroll,
said to be &quot;exceedingly rare.&quot; After a few moments Noda motioned me
over. &quot;Perhaps you could give us your opinion. What do you think?&quot; He
pointed down. &quot;The subject is intriguing. These are ladies-in-waiting for
the emperor, Fujiwara. Notice the delicate refinement of the coloring, the
matched fabrics, each enhancing the other like flowers in a bouquet. That was
eight centuries ago, just before the rise of the first shogun, the first
'generalissimo' who would rule in the emperor's name.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When he said &quot;shogun,&quot; niece Mori shot him a quick
admonitory glance. There was some kind of unmistakable electricity passing.
Something left unspoken.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Heian era ended with the great conflict between the
Heike and Genji clans that led to the death of the ruling emperor in 1185 and
the loss of the imperial sword at sea.&quot; Next he said something in guttural
Japanese to Mori, obviously very intent, and indicated one corner of the
painting, where the emperor sat. Her reply was quick and curt. Now, I only know
a little of the language, maybe a couple of cuts above Berlitz level, but I did
manage to pick up she wasn't talking about the painting. Something to do with
the emperor himself, though I missed the rapid-fire delivery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In response to Noda's question I tried to sound intelligent,
saying the ink coloring looked well preserved, or some such auction house mumbo
jumbo. It wasn't my thing really, which the man surely knew. He seemed to know
everything else about me. After he listened politely, they switched back to
Japanese and finally settled on a bid. I watched as she marked it in the catalogue—low
six figures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Walton, I thought, you're dealing with a pair of
heavyweights.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By then I'd decided not to bother bidding on anything. There
were too many curious twists, not to mention the building deal. Surely the
ritual had gone far enough, the samurai negotiating ploy of making your
adversary be first to reveal his game plan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why not bring up why we were there, just for the hell of it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I did, Noda betrayed a fleeting smile. &quot;But of
course, the building.&quot; He made it sound like some kind of trivial
annoyance, a nuisance to get out of the way so we could all get back to the
serious work of admiring the pretty pictures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Touche</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
I thought. Round one to Noda, on points. &quot;I assume you've had a look at
the package of materials I messengered up to your hotel yesterday?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A broker friend had put together some listings for office
buildings around midtown—it turned out the market was softening a touch due to
the latest construction binge—and I'd hoped that maybe something would catch
Noda's eye. Matter of fact, there were a couple of real bargains over near
Sixth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My people have examined it in detail. We would like to
move forward on the twenty-story building on Third Avenue.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For a second I thought he was joking. Sure we'd tossed in the
write-up, because it fit his profile, but it was a crazy all- cash deal, and
they wanted ninety million, firm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did you read the terms on that one? It's all—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There is a vacant floor, is there not? Available
immediately?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, yes, but—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There may be a few items to clarify—we would like your
legal opinion concerning the leases of the existing tenants—but nothing major.
If the seller is prepared, I think we could even go to contract early next
week, while I'm here. I would like very much to close as soon as possible. If
some of my staff can meet with the seller's attorneys over the weekend, perhaps
we can start work.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Over the weekend? No counter bid, no haggling? Now, you
didn't have to be a brain surgeon to realize this was a fast-track deal; Matsuo
Noda was a man in a hurry. &quot;Looks like you just may have yourself a piece
of property. I'll try and get hold of them in the morning, if I can, and start
the ball rolling.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Excellent.&quot; He hesitated a moment, as though
framing his words, then continued, &quot;But in fact, Mr. Walton, we'd actually
wanted to meet you tonight for an entirely different purpose. I'd hoped we
might be working together on, well, some additional matters.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Something else?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you might surmise, we are not enlarging our presence
here to no purpose. Tonight I wanted to tell you something about the objectives
of Nippon, Inc. And then let you decide if what we propose merits your
participation. Your financial expertise could make you a great asset to
us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hang on, I thought. This thing is starting to go a little fast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you have in mind?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;First let me say you are a man I have long admired.
Your style is not unlike my own. We both understand the importance of moving
cautiously, of keeping our adversaries off guard. Most of all, there is a
rigorous discipline about your work. That is the style of <i>bushido</i>, the
way of the warrior.&quot; He smiled, and his tone lightened. &quot;I think we
could cooperate very effectively.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Already I was wondering whether I really wanted to
&quot;cooperate&quot; any further with Matsuo Noda. Something about the man,
and Miss Mori, made me very nervous. Besides, I was trying to finish off work
now, not begin more. But he'd found out the one line that would keep me
listening. He'd somehow discovered I was a deep admirer of the old-time
military strategists of the East—such as Sun Tzu and Miyamoto Musashi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Like a hostile takeover bid, the ancient Japanese way of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>combat was
ritualized, as mounted warriors rode out, announced their lineage (to the
SEC?), then matched up with men of equal renown. The samurai prized flexibility
over brute strength; they had steel swords that handled like scalpels and body
armor that was a woven mesh of lacquered-iron scales laced together in rows to
create a &quot;fabric&quot; of metal. Those weapons and armor made for agile
movement, easy feints, fast changes in strategy—all trademarks of mine on the
corporate takeover battlefield.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As a result, I fancied myself some kind of samurai too. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The question was, how did <i>Noda </i>know this?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For some reason just then I glanced over toward Akira Mori.
She appeared to be studying a scroll with the detachment of a Zen monk in <i>zazen</i>
meditation, but she wasn't missing a syllable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Care to run through whatever it is you have in
mind?&quot; I indicated one of the ottomans along the side of the room, now clearing
as bidders rose to go inside. I watched as the dark- suited Japanese
businessmen filed past, none with Noda's sense of style, and noticed that
several seemed acquainted with him, pausing to offer obsequious bows.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;With pleasure.&quot; He settled himself. Mori, now
looking over some screens, still didn't elect to join us. &quot;First, may I
presume you already know something of Nippon, Inc.?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No more than what I gleaned from that package you
forwarded. Almost nothing, really.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He laughed, a flash of even teeth. &quot;Perhaps I
should be pleased. These days too much visibility in the U.S. can sometimes
stir up 'friction’.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your prospectus indicated you help banks manage
capital, so I assume you're looking to enter the financial picture here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was the funny part, recall? There was no indication of
any U.S. action in his prospectus. Yet I knew that, overall, Japan's U.S.
investment, private and public, was in the tens and hundreds of billions.
Pension funds and industries were building factories, financing corporations,
snapping up Treasury paper. Japan had become a major source of fresh money for
the U.S. and for the world. But Nippon, Inc. wasn't one of the players.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, we intend to be concerned, initially, with the
position of Japanese capital in the U.S. We are particularly interested in the
matter of Treasury debentures.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was what anybody would have figured. Just that week the
Journal had noted that Japanese investors were expected to cover half of our
Treasury overdrafts for the year. They were advancing us the bucks to keep up
that spending spree known as the national deficit. They sold us Toyotas; we
sold them federal IOUs, using the proceeds to buy more Toyotas. In effect they
were financing the good life, supplying us the &quot;revolving credit&quot; to
buy their cars and DVDs and semiconductors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Treasuries always make a lot of sense.&quot; I picked
up the thread. &quot;Full faith and credit of the U.S. government, all the
rest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Quite so, Mr. Walton, but since all things are
theoretically possible, over the past few months I've undertaken a small
program through subsidiaries of Nippon, Inc. to begin cushioning Japan's
exposure in your Treasury market somewhat.&quot; He paused. &quot;Now that my
effort may be expanding significantly, I was wondering if perhaps you might
consent to serve as our American agent in that endeavor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For a second I didn't grasp what he was driving at, probably
because my involvement seemed totally unnecessary. Surely he realized
Treasuries were bought and sold here every day on the open market through dealer
banks? No big deal. Why bother hiring a middleman?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can make this quick. Why don't you just contact some
of the authorized Japanese brokers here in New York? You must have used them
before. Nomura Securities is well respected. There's also Nikko Securities. And
Daiwa Securities America. They're all primary dealers in Treasury paper now.
Buy or sell whatever you like.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda nodded. &quot;Of course. But we both know the financial
markets can be very delicate. Impressions count for much, which is why I have chosen
to keep a low profile. Consequently, I would prefer to continue to operate for
a time outside normal channels. And in that regard, I now believe it would be
desirable to have an experienced American financial specialist assist us. You,
in particular, would be ideal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I studied him. &quot;Let me make sure I understand this.
You're asking me to step in and begin fronting for you here in the Treasury
market?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is correct, Mr. Walton.&quot; He rose and strolled
over to the row of <i>tachi </i>swords, where Miss Mori was still standing.
They were lying on a spread of dark velvet, and she was scrutinizing them with
a connoisseur's eye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now, I'd like to think I was a quick study of a situation,
but this one was definitely out of whack somehow. If all Noda wanted was to roll
over a little government paper, why the hush-hush? More to the point, why a
whole building in midtown? He could easily do it from Tokyo. The scenario
didn't compute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Before this conversation goes any further, I'd like a
better idea of the kind of activity you're talking about. Selling Treasuries?
Moving the funds into corporate bonds or munis? Commercial paper,
equities.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sell?&quot; He abruptly paused to watch as the staff
began carefully assembling the weapons to take inside for the sale, and his
mind seemed to wander. &quot;You know, Mr. Walton, the sword always has held
the greatest fascination for me. To make one of these, layers of steel of
different hardnesses were hammered together like a sandwich, then reheated,
hammered out, folded, again and again, until there were perhaps a million
paper-thin layers.&quot; He pointed to one of the long blades now glistening in
the light. &quot;You cannot see it, of course, but they used a laminate of soft
steel for the core, harder grades for the cutting edge. And whereas the edge
was tempered quickly to preserve its sharpness, the core was made to cool very
slowly, leaving it pliant.&quot; He suddenly smiled with what seemed
embarrassment and turned back. &quot;I take great inspiration from the sword,
Mr. Walton. The man holding one must learn to meld with the spirit in the
steel. He must become like it. What better than to meet the world with your
hardest surface, yet maintain an inner flexibility, able to bend to
circumstance as the need may arise?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stood a moment as though lost in some reverie then
chuckled. &quot;Sometimes I do tend to go on and on. I believe it was selling
you asked about. The fact is you would not be actually selling Treasury
obligations.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then what . . . ?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you familiar with interest-rate futures?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course.&quot; The question was so unexpected I
answered almost before I thought. Futures contracts were part of the big new
game on Wall Street, although most of the action was still out in Chicago,
places like the Merc and the Board of Trade, left over from the old days when
farmers sold their crops in advance at an agreed-upon price. The farmer
&quot;sold&quot; his grain harvest to a speculator while it was still nothing
but green sprouts. He was worried the price might drop before he got it to
market; the speculator was praying it would head up. The farmer, interestingly,
was selling something he didn't yet have. But even if the price of wheat
suddenly tanked, he was covered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>These days futures contracts were traded for all kinds of
things whose value might change with time. High on that list were financial
instruments such as Treasury notes and bonds, whose resale worth could drop if
interest rates unexpectedly rose. If you owned a bond and were worried it might
go down in value, you could hedge your exposure with a futures contract, in
effect &quot;selling&quot; it in advance at the current price and letting
somebody else assume the risk of future market uncertainty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Modern finance being the marvel it is, you could even sell
bonds you didn't own, just like the farmer's nonexistent grain. The Wall Street
crowd called this a &quot;naked&quot; contract, since you were obligated to go
out and acquire that bond in the open market on the day you'd agreed to deliver
it, even if the price had skyrocketed in the meantime. Or you had to try and buy
back the contract. Of course, you were betting that price would go down,
letting you pocket the difference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Pious spirits on the futures exchanges called these deals
high finance and risk hedging. They operated, however, remarkably like
legalized gambling. Dabbling in interest-rate futures was not for those with a
dicey heart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Our objective,&quot; Noda went on, &quot;is to cushion
Japan's exposure somewhat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;With futures contracts?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Precisely. U.S. Treasury obligations are held by a
variety of investors in Japan, but up until now we have made very little use of
the protection possible in your futures markets. Nippon, Inc. will concern
itself with that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I listened thoughtfully. &quot;So you're saying you want to
create an insurance program for Japanese investors in case the price of
Treasuries weakens?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It made sense. If interest rates went up here, reducing the
value of their government paper, then the price of his futures contracts would
rise to offset the loss.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I glanced over at Japan's monetary guru, Akira Mori, who</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>was carefully
examining her bronze fingernails. Was she the one behind all this sudden
nervousness about America's financial health? What could these two know that we
didn't, I wondered. It was all a bit mysterious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One thing was no mystery, though. Whatever was going on with
Matsuo Noda and Akira Mori gave me a very unsettled feeling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm flattered.&quot; I looked him over. &quot;But
afraid I'll have to pass. This fall I plan to take off for a while and . . .
catch up on some personal matters that—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton,&quot; he cut in. &quot;I would urge you not
to lightly dismiss my proposal.&quot; He was staring back at me intensely.
&quot;I can only say for now that issues are involved . . . well, they
encompass matters of grave international consequence.&quot; Another pause,
followed by a noticeable hardening of tone. &quot;Your other obligations cannot
possibly be as important. It would be in your best interest to hear me
out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Want the truth? At that moment all my negative vibes about
Matsuo Noda crystallized. He wasn't threatening me exactly. Or maybe he was.
The large viewing room was all but empty now. Maybe he'd deliberately waited
before getting down to his real agenda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My other 'obligations' happen to be very important to
me just now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then please consider rearranging them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Besides, my fees can be substantial.&quot; They weren't
all that substantial, but I was looking to slow him down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your fees do not present a problem.&quot; He continued,
&quot;This afternoon a retainer of one hundred thousand dollars was deposited
in your personal account at Chase.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What in hell . . .!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Money is of no consequence in this matter, Mr. Walton.
Time is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You seem awfully sure I'll agree.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We expect your involvement to begin immediately. I
cannot stress too strongly the urgency of what you will undertake.&quot; He
smiled thinly. &quot;I also feel confident a man who enjoys a challenge as much
as you do will find our undertaking . . . intellectually rewarding.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Seems I was hired and I hadn't even said yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This guy had another think coming. Besides, he could get
anybody to do what he wanted. He didn't need me. As I stood</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>there, I
started trying to guess the dimensions of Matsuo Noda's financial hedge. Taken
all together, Japan probably had roughly a hundred billion and change tied up
in U.S. government paper. No way could he be thinking of covering more than a
fraction of that. I knew plenty of law clerks who could do it, for godsake. A
few phone calls to a couple of floor traders in Chicago . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, the most I can do for you is recommend some very
competent brokers I know to help you out. There shouldn't be too much to it.
You'll just have to go easy. You can't hit the market makers in Chicago with
too much action all at once. Prices get out of kilter. Then, too, there are
exchange limits. . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is why we will be trading worldwide.&quot; Noda
withdrew a folded sheet of paper from his breast pocket. &quot;Perhaps you'd
like to glance over our program. These are cumulative totals, which include our
activity to date, but we will begin moving much more rapidly as soon as I've
completed all the financial arrangements with our institutional managers at
home. Perhaps you will see why we need a monetary professional.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was still chewing on the &quot;financial arrangements&quot;
part as I took the paper, opened it, and scanned the schedule of contracts.
While I stood there, the room around us sort of blurred out. I had to sit down
again. All his talk about samurai and nerves of steel was for real.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Matsuo Noda had a program underway to sell futures on a pile
of U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds he didn't own, &quot;naked,&quot; in
an amount I had trouble grasping. I knew one thing, though: if interest rates
headed down, raising the value of those presold obligations, he'd be forced to
cover awesome losses. He'd be in a financial pickle that would make Brazil look
flush. On the other hand, if some disaster occurred and U.S. interest rates
suddenly shot sky high . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Numbers? The CBOT's long-interest contracts, notes and bonds,
are in denominations of a hundred thousand each; the Merc's short paper, bills
and CDs, are in units of a million per. Finally I did some quick arithmetic and
toted up the zeros. Something had to be wrong here. Nobody had balls that big.
I decided to run through the figures again, just to be sure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was along about then that I realized all Noda's pious talk
about sheltering Japanese widows and orphans had been purest bullshit. Resting
there in my hand was the biggest wager slip in world history. Assuming enough
players could be found worldwide to take his action, he was planning to
advance-sell U.S. Treasury IOUs in the amount of five hundred billion dollars.
A full quarter of our national debt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His bet: something or somebody was about to push America over
the brink.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yo, counselor. Get thy butt over here and buy me a
drink.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was standing in the smoky entry of Martell’s, on the way
back downtown from Sotheby's, when I heard the voice, a Georgia drawl known
from Wall Street to Washington. And sure enough, leaning against the long
mahogany bar, the usual Glenfiddich on the rocks in hand, was none other than
Bill Henderson.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Long time, no see. I'd actually stopped by for a little
ninety proof nerve medicine myself, not to pass the time with </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s foremost cowboy market-player. But
the idea of bringing in a Wall Street pro was most welcome. If anybody could
dissect Noda's game, Bill was the man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What was I going to do? I'd stalled on giving Matsuo Noda a
final answer, telling him I needed time to think. Then just to make sure the
whole thing hadn't been some sort of macabre hoax, I'd checked at a Chase bank
machine on Lex. He hadn't been kidding. A retainer had been deposited all
right, presumably by certified check, since it had already cleared. I was on
the payroll, ready or not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda was right about one thing. What he planned to do had
grave international consequences. The problem was, his game had just one
payoff. The way I figured it, he won if, and only if, the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> suddenly went broke. As international consequences
go, that seemed reasonably grave.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
was the perfect guru to take apart the scenario. Assuming he was sober. Tell
the truth, at first glance I wasn't entirely sure. The guy looked a mess. I
assumed he was holding some sort of private celebration, or maybe it was a
wake. What was the occasion?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;William H., welcome back to town. Thought you'd
decamped permanently down to D.C.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Packed it in. Back to start making a living again.
Could be I've just set some kind of new world record for the briefest tenure
ever seen on the Council.&quot; He eased over to make room, while the jukebox
began some Bobby Short standard about incomparable NY. &quot;So where's your TV
star tonight? Sure love that gal.&quot; He toasted Donna's memory. &quot;If
tits were brains, she'd be a genius.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sexist? Tasteless? That was merely </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> warming up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I hadn't actually set eyes on Bill since an ill-fated
birthday dinner Donna had thrown for him in midsummer, a favor to a producer
friend of hers at the station who'd wanted to try vamping a real live
millionaire. That evening he'd arrived with a serious head start on the
whiskey, his meditation on the concept of birthdays, and then proceeded to
regale those assembled with his encyclopedic repertoire of farmer's-daughter
and traveling-salesman vignettes. In the aftermath, Donna swore she'd kill him
if he ever set foot in he</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r
 place</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> again. When I
made the mistake of speaking in his defense, she critiqued a few of my
character defects as well, then added me to the list.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Friend, no small thanks to you and that sordid evening,
I haven't seen Donna since.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That was a dark moment in my history. After listening
half the night to that air-head producer she put next to me, I was in mourning
for the hearts and minds of America.&quot; He revolved back to the bar.
&quot;What're you drinking?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Something serious.&quot; I pointed toward the single
malt. Laphroaig neat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just then Bill paused to watch as two women in bulky
raincoats brushed past. They receded toward the other end of the bar, settled
their coats across an empty stool, and ordered drinks. One was a youngish blonde,
a bit nervous, having some tall, colored potion that looked as if it could use
a cut of pineapple and a plastic monkey on the glass. But the other one,
brunette, was a different story. Pained eyes, with a psychic armor that could
only be called battle-weary New York. Joanna, all over again. Tanqueray
martini. Straight up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hot damn, sure is good to be back in this town.&quot;
He was trying, without conspicuous success, to catch the younger woman's eye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Henderson, you're standing next to a man with some news
that could well alarm you considerably.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Like maybe this dump might run low on booze?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not likely.&quot; I reached for my new drink.
&quot;I've got to make a decision, fast. So try to keep a clear head and see if
you can help me out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In my estimation Henderson was a phenomenon—sober or loaded.
He'd emerged from the red clay hills somewhere in north Georgia, former
football All-State (&quot;I only did it for the pussy&quot;), and ended up at
Yale Law—where we shared an apartment for three whole years. By the time we'd
finished our degrees, I figured I was ready to tackle real life, but Bill had
hung in and gone for a Ph.D. in economics. Although his athlete's physique
hadn't survived Yale—an early casualty of the single malt and the
Dunhills—Henderson still had the delusion he was twenty-five. Easter before
last he'd arrived at my place down in the islands with some leggy print model
half his age and a case of Jack Daniel's Black. Did the redneck routine
bamboozle the cautious hearts of his admiring ladies? Probably. Right under the
radar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All that notwithstanding, it was a commonly accepted fact
that Bill was the sharpest private currency-trader on the East Coast. If
tomorrow the dollar was about to dive, the guy who'd already sold it short
tonight from </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Hong Kong</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> to </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Zurich</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> was invariably </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
That part of his life had been all over the papers the previous spring, after
he got tapped for the President's Council of Economic Advisers. I guess some
genius on the White House staff—urged on by that wily senator from New York,
our mutual friend Jack O'Donnell—concluded the Council needed a pet
&quot;contrarian&quot; on board for appearances, and Henderson looked to be a
sufficiently pro-business prospect. Wrong. After a couple of interviews he was
forbidden to make any more public statements. He'd failed to grasp that the
national interest required fantasy forecasts just before elections. Bill may
have been a master of subtlety when he was trading, but otherwise he tended to
call a spade a spade, or worse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's up?&quot; He was about to punt with the blonde
after one last try.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe you'd better go first.&quot; I took a sip,
savoring the peaty aroma. Let Henderson decompress in his own good time, then
sound him out on Noda's chilling proposition. &quot;What are you doing
here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Call it modesty and discretion.&quot; He turned back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>These were not, as you might infer, the first descriptors
that leapt to mind whenever I thought of Bill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Care to expand?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He slid his hand across the bar, extracted another Dunhill
from its red pack, and launched a disjointed monologue starting with the goddam
traffic in D.C., then proceeding to ditto coming in from LaGuardia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All this time his cigarette had been poised in readiness.
Finally he flicked a sterling silver lighter, the old-fashioned kind, and
watched the orange flame glisten off the mirror at our right. &quot;So, old
buddy, that's it. All the news that's fit to print. History will record this as
the moment yours truly bailed out. I figure it like this. If I can't read the
signals myself these days, what in hell am I doing giving advice? Time to hit
the silk. Get back to making a living. Don't know how long this circus is going
to last, but I figure we'd all better be saddled up and ready to ride, just in
case.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As it happens, self-proclaimed ignorance was a crucial ingredient
in Henderson's deliberate &quot;country boy&quot; camouflage, designed to
disarm the city slickers. I estimated the professional dirt farmer next to me,
Armani double-breasted and gold Piaget timepiece, was now worth about forty
million, including a chunk of an offshore bank. Yet for it all, he still liked
to come across as though he'd just moseyed in and wished somebody would help
him through all this fine print.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't bullshit me, Bill.&quot; I toyed with my drink.
&quot;What you're really saying is you couldn't get anybody else to agree with
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have to admit there were a few trifling differences of
opinion about the direction things are headed.&quot; He positioned his Dunhill
in the ashtray and washed his throat with more Scotch. &quot;You can't cover up
the fundamentals with cosmetics. Things like a megabillion trade shortfall, a
debt nobody can even count, and a dollar that don't know whether to fish or cut
bait. Worst of all, we're still selling the suckers of the world more
funny-colored paper than czarist Russia did. There ain't no quick fix for this
one.&quot; He took another sip, then turned back. &quot;But fuck it. Remember
that old saying I used to have about being a lover, not a fighter. I always
know when it's time to call in the huntin' dogs and piss on the fire. I'm back
in town to stay. I got hold of my boys and they're coming in tomorrow to start
getting everything out of mothballs. We're going back on-line.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As anybody who knew Bill was aware, he'd installed a massive
computer bank in the converted &quot;maid's quarters&quot; of his Fifth Avenue
apartment, hooked to the major futures exchanges and financial markets around
the world. Running his operation on a moment-to-moment basis were a couple of
young fireballs, his &quot;Georgia Mafia,&quot; who did nothing but watch green
numbers blink on a CRT screen and buy and sell all day. He and his boys talked
a language that had very little to do with English—jargon about comparing the
&quot;implied volatility&quot; of options on this currency against the
&quot;theoretical volatility&quot; for that one, etc. On any given day they
were placing &quot;straddles&quot; on yen options, &quot;butterfly
spreads&quot; on pound sterling futures, &quot;reverse option hedges&quot; on
deutsche marks, and on and on. Half the time, Einstein couldn't have tracked
what they were doing. Add to that, they leveraged the whole thing with
breathtaking margins. To stay alive in Henderson's game, you had to be part
oracle, part Jimmy the Greek. You also had to have ice water in your veins. It
wasn't money to him, it was a video game where the points just happened to have
dollar signs in front. The day I dropped in to watch, he was down two million
by lunch, after which we casually strolled over to some shit-kicke</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> on Third Avenue for barbecued ribs
and a beer, came back at three, and by happy-hour time he was ahead half a
million. In the trade Henderson was part of the breed known as a shooter. Up a
million here, down a million there—just your typical day in the salt mines. A
week of that and I'd have had an ulcer the size of the San Andreas fault.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He liked to characterize his little trading operation as
&quot;a sideline to cover the rent.&quot; I happened to know what it really
paid was the incidental costs of a lot of expensive ladies. Could be Bill's
entertainment fund was in need of a transfusion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Back to business?&quot; I asked. &quot;Like the good
old days?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bright and early Monday morning. Got a strong hunch the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Ruskies'll
be in the market buying dollars to cover their September shorts on Australian
wheat futures. Might as well bid up the greenback and make the comrades work
for their daily bread. Then round about eleven, I figure to unwind that and go
long sterling, just before London central figures out what's happening, shits a
brick, and has to hit the market for a few hundred million pounds to steady the
boat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, I thought, Henderson the Fearless hasn't lost his
touch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bill, I want to run a small scenario by you.&quot; I
sipped at my drink. &quot;Say somebody'd just told you he was taking a massive
position in interest-rate futures? What would that suggest?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tells me the man's getting nervous. If he was holding a
lot of Treasury paper, for instance, he'd probably figured rates were about to
head up and he didn't want to get creamed. See, if you're holding a bond that
pays, say, eight percent, and all of a sudden interest rates scoot up to ten,
the resale value of that instrument is gonna go down the sewer. But if you've
already 'sold' it using a futures contract, whoever bought that contract is the
one who's got to eat the loss. You're covered.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not talking about standard hedging.&quot; I was
wondering how to approach the specifics. &quot;Say somebody started selling a
load of bond futures naked. Nothing underlying.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, thing about that is, the man'd be taking one hell
of a risk.&quot; He swirled the cubes in his glass. &quot;Anybody does that's bettin'
big on something we don't even want to think about. Some kind of panic that'd
cause folks to start dumping American debt paper.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I just stood there in silence, examining my glass. That was
precisely my reading of Matsuo Noda's move. &quot;But I can't think of any
reason why anything like that's in the cards, can you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You tell me. It's hard to imagine. The economy's like a
supertanker. Takes it a long time to turn around. But if you want a special </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> shit-hits-the-fan scenario, then I
can give it a shot. Say, for instance, some Monday morning a bunch of those
hardworking folks around the world who've been emptying their piggy banks to
finance our deficit suddenly up and decided they'd like their money shipped
back home. That'd create what's known as a liquidity crisis, which is a fancy
way of saying you don't have enough loose quarters in the cookie jar that
morning to pay the milkman and the paperboy both. The Federal Reserve would
have to jack up interest rates fast to attract some cash. Else roll the
printing presses. Or of course&quot;—he grinned—&quot;we could just default,
declare bankruptcy, and tell the world to go fuck itself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nobody would possibly let it go that far, right?&quot;
I toyed with my Scotch. &quot;Particularly Japan. We owe them more money than anybody.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Wouldn't look for it to happen. Remember though, right
now the U.S. Treasury's out there with a tin cup begging the money to cover its
interest payments. If the national debt was on MasterCharge, they'd take back
our card. So let some of those Japanese pension funds who're shoveling in money
start getting edgy, or the dollar all of a sudden look weak, and you could have
a run on the greenback that'd make the bank lines in '29 look like Christmas
Club week.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's thinking the unthinkable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damned well better be. But don't ever forget, paper
money is an act of faith, and we're in uncharted territory here. Never before
has the world's reserve currency, the one everybody uses to buy oil and grain
and what have you, belonged to its biggest debtor nation. We're bankers for the
world and we're ass over elbow in hock. Everybody starts gettin' nervous the
same day, and the bankers on this planet could be back to swapping shells and
colored beads.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Offhand I'd say that's pretty implausible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And I agree. The system got a pretty good shakeout in
the October Massacre of '87 and things held together, if just barely. Stocks
crashed but the dollar and the debt markets weathered the storm. Nobody dumped.
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> doesn't want its prime customer to
go belly up. Who else is gonna buy all that shiny crap?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I studied my glass again. If Henderson, who had pulse-
feelers around the globe, wasn't worried, then maybe Matsuo Noda was just a
nervous, spaced-out old guy. A loony-tune with an itch to gamble. Funny,
though, he appeared the very essence of a coolheaded banker.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>About then, the two women across the bar waved for their
check and began rummaging their purses. Sadly enough, the brunette had done
everything but send over an engraved invitation for us to join them. She and I
had looked each other over, and we both knew what we saw. The walking wounded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It made me pensive. More and more lately I'd begun to wonder
about the roads not taken, the options that never were. What if all our lives
had started out differently? Where would you be? Where would I be—playing
lawyer now, or maybe driving a cab? It was the kind of woolgathering that drove
Donna Austen insane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was on my mind that first afternoon I met her, when she
brought her sound guy down to record some &quot;voice-overs&quot; to use with
shots of the house. She made the mistake of asking for a little background, so
I decided to go way back and give her the big picture. It turned out to be a
little kinky for the six- o'clock news.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I suited the tale by telling her about my father, once a rig
foreman in the oil patch out around Midland, Texas. I was still a kid when he
started tinkering around weekends with drill bits out in his shop, and I was no
more than about ten when he came up with a new kind of tip. Turned out it could
double the life expectancy of a bit, not to mention the life expectancy of a
lot of roughnecks who had to change them every few hours. He patented the
thing, and next thing you knew, he was &quot;president&quot; of Permian Basin
Petroleum.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your father was a successful inventor?&quot; She'd set
her Tab down on the living room table and perked up. Here was some
&quot;color&quot; for her profile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;More than that. The man was a believing
capitalist.&quot; Was she really going to understand the significance of what
happened? &quot;You see, since no banker would risk loaning out venture capital
back in those days, he had to take PBP public. He needed money so badly he sold
off sixty percent of the company.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Like those entrepreneurs who created home computers in
their garage?&quot; She brushed at her carefully groomed auburn hair. Maybe
here was her hook, the grabber.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Close. He took the money, several million, and started
production. And guess what? The bit he'd invented was too good. Next thing you
know, another outfit that will remain nameless here came along and infringed on
the patent, saying 'sue us'—which he began trying to do. But since they were
already tooled up to manufacture, they undercut his prices and drove PBP's
stock down to zip. Then came the kill. They staged a hostile takeover and—since
PBP now owned the patents, not him—axed the lawsuit. Bye, bye, company.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How does this story relate to what you do today?&quot;
She was checking her watch, no longer overly engaged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, by the time all this happened, I was off studying
engineering at the University of Texas. But when I graduated, I decided to do
something else. I headed for Yale Law.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you can't lick 'em, join 'em? Something like that,
Mr. Walton?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not exactly, Ms. Austen. I wanted to find out if the
Bible's right: that guys who live by the sword better be ready to die by the
sword. After the sheepskin, I shopped around and found the Manhattan law firm
that handled the biggest oil-field-service outfit in the country, then applied
to that firm's corporate department. A couple of years and a lot of memos
later, our oil-field client somehow got the idea they ought to go vertical,
acquire their own source of equipment. Next I ran some numbers and showed them
how profitable it would be to acquire a certain tool company that now owned the
patent on a terrific drill bit. Of course, it would require a hostile buyout,
but with a little restructuring they could swing it financially.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I worked nights and weekends for six months and
personally devised the takeover. By oddest coincidence, when we were through we
decided to strip all that company's overpaid executives of their 'golden
parachutes' and dump them on the street. My graduation present to the old
man.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She rolled her eyes and waved at her sound man to shut off
the mike. &quot;Mr. Walton, I think our viewers would be more interested in
personal stories.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What did she want, I wondered. This was the most
&quot;personal&quot; story I had.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean? What I eat for breakfast?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I do personalities.&quot; She looked around the living
room. &quot;Are you married?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On came the tape. But she didn't get what she wanted. Joanna
wouldn't appreciate being critiqued on Channel Eight's evening news. And Amy
would have killed me. So I just plunged ahead and finished off the other saga.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's a bit more to this intimate bio. Guess I'd seen
enough quick money in the oil business that I'd forgotten you were supposed to
be impressed by it. Or maybe I'd just never mastered the art of kissing my
elders' asses convincingly. You'll find, Ms. Austen, that those are two
attitudes whose rewards are largely intangible; Wall Street compatibility
definitely not being on the list. After five years the Management Committee
offered a partnership, but by then I'd decided to go out and try making it on
my own. Be my own man.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She waved the sound man off again. &quot;You mean you
quit?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Couldn't have said it better. I hung up a shingle . . .
and started playing the other side of the scrimmage line.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I understand you've been in quite a few takeover
fights.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's say I've fought a lot of takeovers, Ms. Austen.
There's a subtle but important distinction.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Donna Austen turned out to be more interested in my marital
status than in anecdotes about corporate mayhem. Thing was, beneath all that
glitz I found her a challenging woman. Amy, on the other hand, despised her.
But then she never likes anybody I bring home. The real problem, however, was
that I kept thinking more about Joanna than I did about Donna. As witness this
evening, when that sadder-but-wiser brunette headed out the door reminded me of
her more than a little. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hate to see that young specimen depart without a
good-faith offer of condolence.&quot; Henderson was wistfully eyeing the young
blonde. Definitely his type. &quot;Trouble is, I couldn't locate the equipment
tonight with a compass and a search warrant.&quot; He hoisted his glass, then
turned back and reached for another Dunhill. &quot;So tell me what brings you
uptown. Never knew you to venture this far into civilization just to stand a
drink for your oldest and wisest confidant.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Back to reality. &quot;William H., you will undoubtedly find
this difficult to accept, but I just got asked to front some Treasury action
for a new client. Selling futures.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where do you find your suckers?&quot; He grinned.
“That's never been your game.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, at least I know the rules. Corporations have been
known to hedge their debt offerings, my friend. But what I've done up to now's
been strictly bush league compared to this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what's the play?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A foreign outfit that wants low profile. And P.S.,
they're talking substantial numbers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean, 'substantial'?&quot; Suddenly
Henderson's input file was on red alert.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Probably wouldn't impress a high roller like you,
Bill.&quot; I paused. &quot;Half a trillion dollars.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jeezus.&quot; He went pale. &quot;Who's putting up the
earnest</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>money for
this shot? Let interest rates head the wrong way, you couldn't cover the margin
calls on a position that size with the GNP of South America.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What if it happened to be some of our friends from
across the Pacific? An outfit that calls itself Nippon, Inc.&quot; I looked at
him. &quot;Ever hear of it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nope.&quot; He just stood there, examining his drink as
though it suddenly had acquired an enormous insect. &quot;But you've got a
surefire knack for really messin' up an evening.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I guess this is what's meant when people talk about the
big time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Christ Almighty. Tell you one thing, that's a hell of a
number to put on the table. I'd sure like to see those boys' hand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe somebody's paying to see ours.&quot; I finished
off my drink and signaled for another. The more I thought about Matsuo Noda,
the more I realized I needed it. &quot;You know, this half scares the crap out
of me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, old buddy, do yourself a favor. Stand clear. Just
back away.&quot; He was getting more sober by the second. &quot;You'd be
lifting up some kind of big rock when you don't know what's under it. I never
do that. Ironclad rule. Same as I always cut losses at ten percent and never
let a long position ride over a weekend. And I'll tell you something else.
Nobody lays down a bet like that unless he knows the casino's fixed.&quot; He
paused. &quot;I wonder if maybe we oughtn't to give Jack a call?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;O'Donnell?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Low-key. Just touch base. Inside word is his Finance
Committee's going to be holding hearings on foreign investment, maybe in a
couple of months. Besides, I know for a fact he owes you a few.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was true. Senator Jack O'Donnell was headed for
reelection headaches. He was America's corporate nightmare— a former professor
of labor law at Columbia who'd gone out and bought some tailored suits, shed
thirty pounds, dyed his hair, and actually gotten elected to the U.S. Senate.
He was despised on Wall Street for good reason. O'Donnell was the Grand
Inquisitor of the corporate scene, hauling CEOs in front of his committee every
time he sniffed some new scam to shortchange stockholders. Since we saw eye to
eye a lot, I'd made it a point to lean on a few of my clients and come up with
some campaign bucks for him, telling them it was good &quot;insurance
money.&quot; Still, if I leaked this to Jack, I'd probably be reading it
tomorrow in The Washington Post.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Henderson, I can't bring him in. Nobody's talking
anything illegal. Still, I'm beginning to think I ought to keep an eye on this
from the inside.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, you haven't been listening. Let me pass along a
major working principle on how to keep your ass intact in this world. Write it
down and tape it to your phone: Staying on the sidelines is a position too.
That applies to Wall Street, and it damned sure applies to life.&quot; He
stretched for a Dunhill, then leaned back. &quot;Ever tell you about that
feisty 'coon hound I used to have, redtick I called by the name of Red?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Only about a hundred times.&quot; Red was his favorite
sermon text.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, ol’ Red somehow conceived the idea he was just
about the meanest fucker in the county, and he was always out to prove it. Then
one night he made the mistake of treeing a big old mama 'coon, up in this
little sycamore we had down by the creek. I heard him barking and raising hell
and I knew I wouldn't get a wink if I didn't go down and see about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Henderson, Christ, I've already heard this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I'm gonna finish it anyhow, by God. Sounds like
you could use a refresher course.&quot; He took a drink. &quot;Now then, after
I made it through the copperheads and briers and got down there, naturally the
first thing I did was shine that tree with my light and count the eyes. Turns
out that mama raccoon had a bunch of her little ones up there too. So she was
in a real disagreeable frame of mind. Her eyes were bright red and I could tell
she was thinking she just might eat herself a smartass hound for supper. I
tried to explain this to Red, call him off, and get him to come on back up the
house, but no, sirree, nothing would do but he had to take her on. So I figured
it was time he had a little reality contact. I chunked a couple of rocks, got
lucky, and down she tumbled. Next thing ol’ Red knew, he thought he had his ass
caught in a brand-new John Deere hay baler. I finally had to kick her off him
and get her back up the tree before she really got mad.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, I hear you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Listen up, friend. There's a moral. You see, ol’ Red
didn't have enough expertise that night to know when to stand off. But I'll
tell you one thing: he learned real fast. Next time he chased that particular
mama up that sycamore, he took one sniff and just trotted right on back to the
house.&quot; He sipped again. &quot;Every time I come across a tree full of
something I don't know about, I remember old Red and just turn around and walk
away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm taking your warning under advisement.&quot; I threw
down a fifty, glanced at the soundless Mets game on the TV over the bar, and
reached for my coat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'd damned well better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, get some sleep. As a friend and
colleague, I must in all honesty advise you, you look like absolute hell.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've always valued your candor.&quot; He waved for
another drink. &quot;But I've got some heavy thinking to do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, get home safe. Let's keep in touch.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He saluted with his glass. &quot;Tell you what, Matt, maybe
I'll just do a little sniffing around myself, see if I can't get a fix on what's
up the tree.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay.&quot; I was putting on my coat, checking through
the window to see if the rain had stopped. Looked like it had. &quot;Let's both
sleep on it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You do that.&quot; He wasn't smiling as I headed out
the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Henderson, who could slumber like a baby when he was down a
million for the day, didn't look like he had much rest ahead that night. For
all my brave talk, I didn't either. Now that the rain was over, I wandered over
to Fifth to look at the trees sparkling in the streetlights. And to think. If you're
from </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>West Texas</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, you love to see green things wet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I hailed a cab downtown, still with lots of unanswered
questions on the subject of Matsuo Noda. What had happened to my country that
could make it so vulnerable to the financial shenanigans of a single
white-haired foreign banker? Was this what people meant when they talked about
the tides of history? Was the free ride over?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Back when I was a kid, I'd accepted as an article of faith
that </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> was the greatest, that we were
destined to lead the world forever. Was that hubris? Now I had this sinking
feeling we were about to begin learning a little modesty. Maybe Amy didn't know
it yet, but her </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> was going to end up being a lot
different from mine. All of a sudden folks all over the world were about to be
richer than we were. It was going to take some painful adjustment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's when I finally decided. Yes, by God, I would track
this one. And when I figured out what Noda had up his sleeve. I'd blow the
whistle. Somebody needed to stand guard over this country, and if not me, who?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Matt Walton vs. Matsuo Noda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As it turned out, the evening still wasn't over. Things
continued to go off track, beginning with when I walked in my front door. I
guess by now everybody's pretty blase about urban crime, but it's still always
a shock when it happens to you. I also think it's getting worse. I can remember
five years ago when Joanna and I never bothered even to latch the street
windows. These days they have bars—a small precaution following an evening on the
town during which everything we owned with an electric cord attached walked out
into the bracing </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Manhattan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> night. That was my first experience
with the hollow feeling in your gut when you realize your sanctum has been
plundered. It's not the lost toys, it's the violation that gnaws at your karma.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This time, though, it appeared to be minor. No forcible
entry. Somebody had actually picked the front-door lock, a fact I only
established to my satisfaction after every other possibility had been
considered and dismissed. Truthfully, I probably wouldn't have noticed anything
at all that night if not for a wayward train of thought on the way home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd been meditating on a particular sword in my collection, a
<i>katana</i>, which was totally without distinction except for a little oral
history. Reportedly the blade once tasted blood in a rather arcane episode.
Noda probably would have approved. The story was, the samurai who'd
commissioned it decided he liked it so much he didn't want the swordsmith
telling anybody how he'd forged it. So after he'd thanked the guy graciously,
deep bows and all the rest, he picked up the sword, bowed one more time, and
then hauled back and sliced him in half, clean as a whistle. The <i>kesa </i>stroke,
left collarbone straight through the right hip. It's said a samurai could do
things such as that in the old days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My meeting with Noda had made me want to look it over, to
refresh my memory concerning that Japanese capacity for the unexpected. So
after I let myself in through the front foyer, I tossed my raincoat over a
banister, headed down to the kitchen to pour myself a nightcap, and proceeded
upstairs to the &quot;office.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I clicked on the light and then . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jesus! The place had been trashed. Drawers open, files</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>tipped over,
piles of paper askew. After the first numbing shock, that perception-delay your
senses impose before you can actually accept what you're seeing, I quickly
started taking inventory. Okay, what did they get this time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, the computer and printer were both intact, cordless
phone was there still, the little nine-inch Sony in the corner was untouched. .
. . Hey, could it be they hadn't actually lifted anything?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I remembered why I'd come upstairs. Off to the side,
under the back stair, was a big walk-in closet I called my sword room, always
kept under lock and key. I glanced over at the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hold on. It was hanging open slightly. I strolled over and
checked it more closely. The mechanism had been jimmied, professionally, but
with enough force that the metal frame around the door was askew. Not a blatant
entry, but a determined one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My heart skipped a beat. That's why they didn't bother with
TVs. These guys knew where the real action was, the lightweight, very expensive
loot. I opened the door, took a deep breath, and felt for the light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>You could have heard my sigh of relief all the way out in the
street. From the looks of it, nothing was missing here either.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Be sure now. I quickly glanced down the racks, mentally
cataloging the pieces. Everything had a place, and all the places were still
full. Strange. This stuff was worth thousands. Burglars break in to steal. So
what happened? Maybe something scared them off. My sheepdog Benjamin, the
fearless terror of the streets? He was now snoring at the foot of the stairs,
but who knows . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Walton, you lucky stiff, this could have been a major hit. I
cursed at the thought of having to have the door and lock repaired, made a
mental note to remember to call the locksmith over by </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Sheridan Square</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> in the morning, and pushed the
damaged door closed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What a hell of a night. I pulled the Sotheby's catalogue out
of my pocket, recalling the auction that had inaugurated this fateful evening,
and turned to chuck it in the file cabinet where I kept all the records for my
hobby: prices, news clippings, correspondence, the rest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The cabinet, one of those cheap tin jobs you buy at discount
office-supply places, was slightly askew. What's this? I yanked open the top
drawer and saw chaos.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Uh, oh. I went down the row, checking. Tell you one thing, my
intruders had been thorough. Every drawer was a mess, just like the office.
Then I got to the bottom, the one with backup data on the collection.
Appraisals, provenance of the pieces, that kind of thing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was empty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But of course! Any pro would know that half the value of a
collection such as this would be in all the documentation. Which meant my
methodical thieves were no dummies; they'd started with the paperwork, the
valuations and authenticity info . . . which meant they weren't through. I must
have interrupted their . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God! They could still be here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I edged for the phone and punched 911, the police emergency
number. Next I went back and pulled down a sword, just for protection, and
swept the empty house. It was all nice and tidy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New
  York</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s men in blue
showed, an overweight Irishman and his Puerto Rican partner, both with
mustaches. I actually knew them, having once received a ticket for walking Ben
off the leash. We went through the formalities, lots of questions with no
answers worth writing down, and then they offered to send around a fingerprint
squad in the morning. Sure, why not. And you'd better get new locks for this
place, Mr. . . . Walton. Right. We all thanked each other and I saw them out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I headed back down to the kitchen. What was this all
about? Stealing files? Papers? Those documents, lovingly and painstakingly
assembled, were what made the swords somehow uniquely a part of my life.
Something that actually wasn't going to decide to take a hike the next week.
The stuff had no value to anybody except Matt Walton.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Some people will swear life runs on coincidence. Is
it true? If so, here's one for the history books. It's the tale of an old
flame. Before my ex-wife Joanna, before my later ill-starred adventure with
Donna Austen. The lady's name was Tamara Richardson, and she was a professor at
  New York University. When I knew her, though, she was merely an assistant
prof with a shiny new Ph.D. At any rate, she was fresh out of Columbia's
graduate school and very much starting out. I was too. Best I can remember, we
met shopping for green groceries at Balducci's, just up Sixth Avenue from my
place, and we saw each other a few times. It had to be at least fifteen years (how
time flies) since our brief episode.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Richardson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, however, was not easy to forget.
There was a kind of under-the-surface intensity about the woman that seemed
always close to the ignition point. When you were around her, you were always
worried somebody might accidentally light a match. However, she had no shortage
of men in her life, and eventually we each went our own way. Ships that passed
in the night. I never expected to hear of her again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Things didn't quite work out that way, however. She started
getting famous, as a thorn in the side of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s
lackadaisical corporate management. Somewhere along the line, Tam Richardson
had taken it upon herself to single-handedly kick some overpaid ass in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s plush boardrooms, and she wasn't
trying to win any popularity contests doing it. She was the kid in the story
who pointed out the emperor had on no pants, while everybody else was claiming
his tux was a great fit. Guess you can't fire somebody in academia merely for
saying what everybody knows to be true but doesn't have the guts to verbalize.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then about a year ago, I noticed a full-length profile of her</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>in an
airline magazine spread about &quot;</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s
New Achievers.&quot; No escaping her. Between the lines, I got the definite
impression she hadn't really changed all that much over the years. She was
around five seven, high cheekbones, dark hair that looked like it could use a
brush, and eyes that made you think twice about giving her a lot of bullshit.
Reminded me of, say, the young Glenda Jackson with a heavy spike of Debra
Winger. For my money, though, she was just about ideal in the female
department. Trim bottom, nice little twist in her stride, just enough cleavage
to make you wonder. She didn't go out of her way to advertise, but you figured
the goods were on board. My recollection in a nutshell? Tam </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Richardson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> was a better than average looker,
damned smart, and she knew no fear. None.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was something about her, though, that always left
people puzzling. Where'd she come from? American, sure, but no way could she
have been corn-fed </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Midwest</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> like her surname. The answer was,
she had a slightly more exotic, and probably painful, history than most of us.
Maybe that was part of the reason she always seemed to be a loner, never went
along with the crowd. The one time she'd tried that, it hadn't worked. I got to
know her well enough to hear a bit of the story, but I'd sort of repressed the
details.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe I'd do well to come clean and admit I still thought
about Tam from time to time. What's more, I gleaned from the magazine piece
that she still lived right around the corner. Made me think briefly about
giving her a call, get together for a drink, the old days, etc. But I finally
decided I'd had enough high-spirited women for a while. Time to mellow down. Why
go looking for lightning in a bottle?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She'd always liked three things: good-looking men, telling
the high and mighty unpleasant truths, and interior design. Consequently it was
no great surprise that the magazine devoted a photo spread to her rambling six-room
apartment. The place was in one of those NYU-owned buildings on the west side
of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Washington</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Square</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
 </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Park</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, and it was definitely a knockout.
She'd played off the old classic interior, a generously proportioned thirties
layout, turning it into an environment that blended technology and design. Not
for Tam, though, the utilitarian &quot;high-tech&quot; look so trendy a few
years back; no ugly &quot;state of the art&quot; machines. It was
eclectic—modernism here, deco there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Take her library-office. I smiled when I noticed that next to
the latest IBM PC was a &quot;streamlined&quot; Raymond Loewy- designed
calculator, pure thirties. Same old Tam. On the other hand, just to keep it all
from getting too serious, she also had a collection of kitschy salt and pepper
shakers scattered among the books—a dog peeing against a hydrant, a naked babe
with spicy boobs . . . she told the writer it was her &quot;tribute to </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The place was everything she was, a potpourri of the world, a
mishmash of styles, and she clearly loved it. I probably missed a good half of
the insider gags, this outrage up against that one, but I must say she brought
it off with appreciable <i>elan</i>. Truthfully the place was a perfect
reflection of the Tam I remembered—a woman who did her own thing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was now, so it said, a full professor at the university.
Undoubtedly she deserved it. She was also director of their new Center for
Applied Technology, which she'd founded. When the interviewer asked her which
department the Center was under, she'd apparently shrugged and said &quot;certain
people&quot; at the university wanted to bring it in under the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>School</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> of </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Business</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. But the Center had outside funding, was doing vital work,
and she was darn well going to stay independent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whoops. That ballsy crack, although perfectly in character,
meant she was now giving the back of her hand to university politics. Mouthing
off in a national publication about some departmental power play is no way to
endear yourself to college deans. It lays bare all their petty empire-building.
Didn't seem to worry her, though; just like in the old days, she said exactly
what she was thinking and let the chips tumble.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her major occupation in recent years, as anybody who reads
the op-ed pages around the country knows, was to shame American executives into
getting off their duffs, to make them start diverting some of their executive
perks into the serious problem of getting this country competitive again. She
had plenty of ideas where the corporate-jet money could be better invested.
Over the years she'd knocked out half a dozen books on technology and the
American workplace—office automation, computer-aided design in engineering,
robots and computer-integrated manufacturing, that kind of thing. Tam </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Richardson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> still believed </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> could whip the world, but it would
take more than speeches and flag waving. Her latest expose of America's
corporate fat cats, which actually got a sidebar in the story, claimed they'd
better start cutting their million-dollar salaries and putting the money into
creating American jobs, or we'd all soon end up fetching coffee for the new
Pacific Rim dynamos and buying our goodies at East Asia's company store.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Only she didn't bother to say it that nicely. Worse than
that, the book actually supplied a long list of </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>'s more notoriously overpaid CEOs. I suspect there were a lot
of corporate contributors to the university who'd just as soon seen her
muzzled. Good luck, Tam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now the coincidence. The Saturday following my Friday night
episode with the inscrutable president of Nippon, Inc., an event occurred that
would soon bring Tam Richardson back into my life. Random luck? Fate? Anybody's
guess. As it turned out, however, while I was on the phone leaving messages at
country clubs for the building's attorneys, a mere five blocks away from my
place Dr. Tamara Richardson was putting the final touches on preparations for
an evening dinner party—destined to throw us together again only weeks later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The dinner was supposed to be strictly social, to celebrate
the beginning of her sabbatical—academic talk for a year off with
three-quarters pay. There were a few dinner debts to square away, so the timing
was perfect. She had several articles lined up; she'd finally axed a stormy
year-long affair with a colleague in Economics named </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>David</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> Mason; and she was scheduled to begin a book on
intelligent robots. She was trying not to think too much about academic
politics and the real possibility her department chairman might consign her to
some kind of academic hyperspace, there to teach freshmen for the rest of her tenured
days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By mid-afternoon she was down to the last-minute refinements
on the evening's plans. Since the overnight rain had purged the soot from the
air, she was feeling great. She put on a new Vangelis CD, worked a few
modern-dance moves into her routine as she cleared the loose books out of the
living room, and continued trying to convince herself that breaking off with
Dave Mason had been a smart move. After a while, though, she wasn't humming
anymore, just thinking. Okay, it had only been a week, but why had she invited
him to come to the dinner? Just to be a good sport?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The thing about it was, they'd actually had a more or less</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>unspoken
understanding not to inquire too closely into each other's occasional little
diversions. They were both adults, right? This time, however, Dave had pushed
it too far. He'd finally broken the rules, bringing one of his admiring grad
students up to the apartment—her apartment. She bumped into them coming down in
the elevator, and this one was a prize—stage makeup, bleached hair, the works.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Out of bounds. She'd nailed him right there in her marble
lobby: you want to bang some </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Queens</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> debutante, you'd better not be doing
it here. This place is my home. She then told him to pack. The apartment was
hers, and she wanted all signs of him out by Monday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she'd invited him back for the dinner. Why? Could
Humpty-Dumpty be put back together again? Crack eggs, make an omelet . . . she
half smiled at the odd way your mind connects absurdities when you're a little
overworked. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when the phone rang.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was it Dave, dropping out at the last minute to prove he
could still piss her off, one more time? She headed for the kitchen, so she
could at least chop some veggies while they argued for half an hour on the
phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It wasn't Dave. Instead it was a scratchy old voice, one she
loved. Shouting into a cell phone at Kennedy was Allan Stern, who announced in
his staccato tones that he'd just stepped off a JAL flight fresh from some
conference in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. He had to see her tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tonight?&quot; When it rains, it pours, she thought.
&quot;Allan, I'd love to, but I'm having some people in from school . . . What?
. . . Well, sure, nothing that special . . . Allan, I adore you dearly, but you
wouldn't know any of the . . . Okay, okay . . . Can you get down by
eight?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;See you then, Tamara. You're a dear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stern was an old, old friend, and a guy everybody in the
country had probably heard of vaguely. Any freshman in computer science could
tell you he was one of the unofficial founders of the field known as artificial
intelligence, now usually shortened to &quot;AI.&quot; As it happened, she had
convinced him the previous spring that they ought to collaborate on a book
about the growing use of smart robots in the workplace, but for some reason his
input had never made it past the talking stage. She'd decided just to go ahead
on her own with the writing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, she thought, maybe he's decided to pitch in after all.
Great. That would mean it might be adopted for a lot of college courses. Allan
had plenty of respectability with the establishment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was probably the closest friend she had, her mentor
almost. They went back to a Denver conference fifteen years agp, when he'd
stood up in a session and challenged the conclusion of the very first paper she
ever gave, though he'd come in midway through. Even then he had been a
powerhouse in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Washington</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, chairing one of the technical
committees that reviewed federal grant applications submitted by university
researchers. The inside talk on campuses was: love him or hate him, but think
twice before you cross the opinionated bastard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was so mad she didn't care. She had sidled up to him at
the coffee break and introduced herself, saying what an honor it was to meet a
scholar so highly regarded, a man whose reputation was so well established. He
nodded in absent acknowledgment, sipped at his Styrofoam cup, and stared over
her shoulder. She then proceeded to advise the celebrated Allan Stern that he'd
missed the whole thrust of her talk, which she'd explained in the introduction,
and furthermore—judging from the data at hand—he struck her as a pompous
asshole.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Such forthrightness, which was entirely new to Dr. Allan
Stern's sheltered existence, so astonished him he apologized on the spot. By
week's end he was trying to recruit her out to Stanford. He still was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Allan was always punctual, to the minute, and that Saturday
night was no exception. The doorman downstairs announced him at eight sharp.
When she met him at the elevator, her first impression was he looked a trifle
worn down. America's foremost futurist was gaunt, as always, but his trademark
shock of white hair streamed over a lined face that was more than usually
haggard. His hard eyes, which could bore through screw-off Congressional
staffers like a pair of Black &amp; Decker drills, were actually bloodshot. In
short, the man looked awful. Then she remembered he'd just come in on the 747
directly from Narita. Into the teeth of the latest baggage-handlers' slowdown
at Kennedy. Give the poor old guy a break.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She made him a drink and then asked, &quot;Okay, Allan,
what's up?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Later, Tamara. It's a long story.&quot; With which he
lapsed silent. Very out of character.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>About then everybody else started coming up, reasonably on
time since Tam was known far and wide to hate the concept of &quot;fashionably
late.&quot; Also, she was a great cook. Bottles of bargain wine with the prices
scraped off collected on the table in the foyer, and coats amassed in the
second bedroom. Given that everybody knew everybody, it was mostly elbow
patches and open collars. Only the women had bothered to dress. Simpson from
Computer Science, whose wife worked in Admissions; Gail Wallace from Business,
whose pudgy, skirt- chasing husband had guided two companies into bankruptcy;
Alice and Herman Knight, who both taught in Economics (she was dean of the
undergraduate college) and published as a team; Kabir Ali from Mathematics and
his browbeaten little Iranian wife Shirin who seemed frightened of the
world—and her husband. Only Dave had the nerve to be late and hold things up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While they waited, they knocked off a little Scotch and white
wine, trashed the administration, and complained about all the committees on
which they were being pressured to serve. Around a quarter to nine Dave finally
appeared, sandy curls askew to let her know where he'd been. She didn't even
bother offering him a drink, just announced that everything was ready so let's
adjourn to the dining room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There're two kinds of dinners: ones that follow the rules,
and ones that break them all. Tarn's were the latter. This time it would be
real tallow candles and everybody's wine, including her own. Somehow her
craziness always seemed to click; they inevitably came back for more. This time
she'd decided to pay an offhand tribute to autumn and American cuisine. Cheddar
cheese soup, marinated Ottomanelli's quail broiled with fresh sage, sweet
potato fritters and baby peas, homemade corn bread, and then, as a change of
pace (keep 'em off balance), an endive salad spiked with coriander. Dessert was
an apple- walnut casserole, washed down with pots of McNulty's dark Haitian
coffee. At the end she produced an ancient cognac you could inhale forever. By
eleven-thirty everybody thought they'd just ascended to paradise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She ordered Dave to take care of the dishes (since he'd</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>been acting
as if he owned the place, let him help), then led everybody back into the
living room. In the park below the weather was perfect, and marijuana sales
were in overdrive. A couple of joints also appeared around the room,
accompanied by withering glares from Allan. Then, while Ed Wallace was chatting
up Shirin and everybody else was drinking and smoking, Allan picked up his
cognac and motioned her in the direction of the study.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally, she thought. This must be some story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It wasn't her book he wanted to discuss. Instead, he wanted
to tell her about what he'd just seen, and not seen, in Tokyo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Loved dinner.&quot; He settled into a leather chair,
the one next to her long bookcase, and drained his snifter. &quot;I was afraid
I was turning into a fish over there.&quot; He laughed, but only briefly.
Social hour was over. &quot;Tam, I wanted to ask you if you could maybe help me
out with something.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you have in mind?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, you know I've always thought I was on top of what
Tokyo is doing, but now I'm not so sure anymore. I'm afraid things are starting
to get away from me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Such as?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay. Now, it's no secret I've been to Japan a lot.
I've got my share of friends over there, people I respect and admire very much.
But this trip started to get very strange. It's as though I'm suddenly an
outsider. Just another <i>gaijin</i>. I'm puzzled, and I wonder if maybe I
ought to be worried.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Gaijin</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
That sounds familiar, she thought. But it wasn't something that usually
bothered Allan. She brushed her brown hair back out of her eyes and studied
him. He'd never been more serious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What happened?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He paused. &quot;You know about their big artificial
intelligence effort, called the Fifth Generation Project. If it goes the way
they're saying, before too much longer they'll have programs, software, to
design the next generation of computer technology. &quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was supposed to be news? Come on, Allan. Everybody knew.
It was the talk of the industry. Japan's goal was computer logic capable of
replicating human thought processes, a monumental, maybe impossible,
undertaking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Allan, don't you remember we discussed doing a chapter
on it in the robotics book? And if you—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tamara, bear with me. You also know very well that
project is Japan's attempt to leapfrog American technology. Added together with
all their R&amp;D on chip technology. In my opinion, by the way, our response
is definitely too little, too late. More and more we're having to buy essential
components for missile guidance systems from Japan. The Department of Defense
is already nervous, but not nervous enough. We may have dug our own grave. And
now I think our worst fears may be about to come true. Something funny seems to
be happening, only I'm not sure what.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me close that door.&quot; He got up and did so, then
turned back. &quot;Maybe first I ought to tell you about the odd experience I
had last week.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Go on.&quot; She heard somebody in the living room put
on one of her old Beatles albums—still the middle-ager's idea of hip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, as always, I scheduled a stop at the Fifth
Generation lab to get up to speed on how their effort's doing. But all of a
sudden it seems I'm too darned famous to be bothered with the shirtsleeve
stuff. I tried to get in there for three days running. It was always the
honorable Stern-san this and the celebrated Stern-san that and you must meet
the head of every damned ministry and we have to set up this formal dinner and
blah, blah, blah.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Allan, you're the Grand Old Man these days.&quot; She
laughed. &quot;Get used to it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Wash out your mouth, Tamara Richardson. I'm not grand
and I'm most decidedly not old.&quot; He sniffed. &quot;No, it's as if they
were very politely cutting me out. Okay, they didn't exactly say the project
was off-limits now or anything, but there never seemed to be a convenient time
to drop by the lab.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who knows? Maybe they just didn't want some American
partisan poking about the place anymore.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Could be. But why? I'm scarcely a spy for DOD, or the
CIA. They know I only do pure science. Okay, maybe I'm old- fashioned, but Dr.
Yoshida at least has always claimed to respect me for that. I used to spend
hours with him going over his work there and vice versa. We swapped ideas all
the time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Now all of a
sudden there's this smokescreen.&quot; He paused, sipped at his brandy, and
then leaned back. &quot;Which brings me to that favor I need.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I was wondering if maybe you could try and get
into the Fifth Generation lab yourself, check around a bit. See if you can find
out what's cooking.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Go to Tokyo?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I realize it's a lot to ask, but who else can I turn
to? Tam, you're the only person I know who could pull this off. You know the
technology, and they respect you. Also, you understand the language. Maybe you
can cut through all the politeness and the translated PR. If you'd like a
little per diem, I'll see if I can't shake loose the money from
somewhere.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Allan, really, don't you think you're maybe going
overboard just a little. What if Dr. Yoshida was just tied up? The last time I
visited the lab, he showed me everything, completely open.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ho, ho.&quot; He set down his brandy, and his eyes
hardened. &quot;I still haven't told you the clincher. There's some new guy in
charge now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's hard to believe. Yoshida practically invented
the Fifth Generation Project. He's the director—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's just it. Kaput. All of a sudden he's not around
anymore. They said he's now 'technical adviser.' But you know what that really
means. Removed. <i>Sayonara</i>. Promoted upstairs or downstairs or some damn
thing. That in itself is mystifying. He's one of the most competent . . . oh,
hell, the man is a genius. Why would they do that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very strange.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Exactly. But now he's out. Couldn't even see me. 'On
vacation.' The new director is some bureaucrat by the name of Asano. I spent a
little time with the man, and I can testify he's a smoothie. Lots of pious
generalities about 'technical cooperation.' But I got the distinct feeling he
didn't want to talk details with me. Actually, I wondered if maybe he wasn't
even a bit afraid to say anything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Asano? Oh, shit. She took a deep breath. &quot;Was his name
Kenji Asano?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken. Right, that's his first name. Maybe you know him.
I think he used to be a flunky with some government bureau</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>over there.
But now he's just been put in charge of the Fifth Generation work. It's more
than a little curious.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She puzzled a minute. From what she knew about the Fifth
Generation, and about Kenji Asano, he had a lot more important things to do
than run the lab. The &quot;government bureau&quot; he worked for was none
other than MITI, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. In fact, at
last count he was Deputy Minister for Research and Planning, a top-ranked
executive slot. Could this mean that </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s
ambitious artificial intelligence effort was being moved in on by MITI, their
industrial war room?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Allan, I'll tell you the truth. You may not have heard,
but I'm in a fight now at the university. I expect to win, but I've got a lot
on my mind. Notes for the book. I can't just suddenly—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, I need your help. Look, maybe they've had some new
breakthrough that none of us ever imagined.&quot; He paused. &quot;Just between
us, I lifted a strange MITI memo I found lying around an office when Asana took
me on an escorted tour up to the labs at </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Tsukuba</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
 </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Science</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>City</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked at him. &quot;Was it classified?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How would I know? There was something about it. My
sixth sense told me it was a document nobody was supposed to see. When I get
back to Stanford, I plan to have a postdoc over in Physics make me a quick
translation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was very unlike Allan to walk off with confidential memos
uninvited. Which could only mean he must suspect something he wasn't telling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'd better give me the whole story.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not now. Not yet. It's only guesswork, Tam.&quot; He
glanced away. &quot;Nothing to bore you with at the moment. But if you can find
out anything, we'll write it up as a report I can circulate around the Hill.
This could be important, believe me. Already Cray has started having to buy
critical chips for its supercomputers from </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
And while the Department of Defense is pouring billions into research on
semiconductors that will withstand nuclear radiation, </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> is forging ahead on speed and miniaturization—what
really counts. I think they could be about to have us by the balls, pardon my
French. If they've somehow incorporated AI—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Allan, it doesn't add up. I once met Asano. In fact it
was a couple of years ago at that Kyoto University symposium on</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Third World
industrialization. He spent a lot of time trying to pick my brain about our
specialized silicon-chip manufacturing here. But he wasn't the slightest bit
interested in artificial intelligence.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, prepare yourself for a surprise. He's plenty
interested now. And knowledgeable. But still, it's not like the Japanese to do
something like this, install some government guy to run an R&amp;D
program.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's certainly true.&quot; She strolled over, looked
down upon the park, and began to want a brandy of her own as she chewed over
the implications. Was MITI setting up some new high-tech industrial assault? If
the Fifth Generation had been taken over by Kenji and his planners . . .
&quot;Allan, let me think about this for a couple of days.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't think too long. I'm convinced somebody over there
is suddenly in a very big hurry. I need to find out the real story. Am I just
starting to go nuts in my old age? . . . Well, make that my prime.&quot; He
grasped her hand for emphasis. &quot;And you really should make it a point to
see this Asano fellow. If you already know him from somewhere, I'd say that's
even better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She started to respond, then stopped. She knew Kenji Asano
all right. From a little episode at that conference, when he had invited the
panel members of a session he chaired to a late-night tour of the endless tiny
bars in Kyoto's Gion district. She remembered all the steaming sake and being
ignored by flustered bar girls who were pretending that another woman wasn't
around. They had no idea what to do about a member of their own sex there in
their sanctuary of male flattery. Ken apparently had staged it mainly to watch
their reaction, and hers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Part of the scene was that Ken Asano was actually something
of a hunk, as Westernized as they come and attractive in that way seemingly
reserved for men of great wealth or great power. He may have had both, but she
was sure only about the second. Whenever he handed out that <i>meishi</i> card
with the MITI logo, even millionaire industrialists and bankers automatically
bowed to the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A lot of sake later, after the other panel members had piled
into a cab for their hotel, she decided to show Kenji Asano a few things about
women he wouldn't learn from giggling bar girls. She'd always heard that
Japanese men were pretty humdrum in bed, quick and self-centered, at least in
the opinion of a woman she knew who'd done exhaustive field research on the
topic. After her own experience with Ken, though, she wasn't so sure. Still, it
had been a passing thing. The next morning she awoke in her own room in the
Kyoto International and half tried to tell herself it hadn't really
happened—just a dream, a chimera of the sultry Kyoto night, brought on by all
those quaint little side streets and red paper lanterns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The truth was she still thought about him from time to time.
He was a talented lover, she certainly recalled that part well enough, and he
was a charmer. In fact, she could use a little of that charm right this minute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What she didn't admire was the organization he worked for:
the infamous MITI. Behind a smokescreen of &quot;fair trade&quot; rhetoric,
MITI's intentions clearly were to extinguish systematically Japan's world
competition, industry by industry. And so far they were batting a thousand.
They'd never once failed to knock off a designated &quot;target.&quot; What was
next? Had MITI finally concluded that, down the road, intelligent computers
could be the drive behind some massive shift in world power?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe she should go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She poured another dash of cognac for Allan, and they
wandered back into the living room, just in time to see the Simpsons out.
Everybody else followed except for Dave, now perched by the windows and glaring
out into the dark. She decided to ignore him as she walked over, opened one a
crack, and looked down. In the park below, commerce was tapering off and the
Jamaican Rastas had begun toting up receipts for the night. No sounds, except
the faint strains of reggae from a boom box.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Funny, but every once in a while she'd stop everything and
watch the kids in the playground down there. What to do? The damned shadows
were growing longer by the minute. Maybe Dave wasn't so bad. Trouble was, he
needed mothering too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Think about it tomorrow, Scarlet. She sighed, poured herself
a cognac, and headed for the bedroom to get Allan's coat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After she'd put him on the elevator, she came back and
checked out Dave, now slouched in the big chair by the lamp, his eyes closed.
He looked positively enticing, and she sounded his name quietly. Nothing. Then
she realized he was sound asleep. Snoring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The bastard. This was it. She grabbed his coat, pushed him
out the door, poured herself another cognac, and plopped down in the living
room to think.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All right, Allan. You've got a deal. Could be you're on to
something. I seem to remember there's a conference in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> starting week after next on supercomputers. Kenji
Asano will probably show. Good time to catch him off guard and try to find out
what's suddenly so hush-hush.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, by God, I'll do it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She didn't bother with any of Allan Stern's funding. This
trip would be strictly off-the-record. She wrapped up some loose ends, called a
few people she knew in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, lined up half a dozen interviews
that might be helpful on the new book, packed her toothbrush and tape recorder,
and boarded a Northwest flight for Narita.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She had no idea then, of course, but she was </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Alice</span><span style='font-size:

was dining with the Emperor of Japan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Allan Stem's alarm about </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s
semiconductor challenge reflected only part of the picture. There was also
plenty going on with Japanese research in addition to information processing.
Superconductivity was getting a big push, as was biotechnology,
optoelectronics, advanced materials. Although we in the West think of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> as a newcomer in the high-tech sweepstakes, it
actually has a long tradition of innovation. A typical for-instance: in the
area of advanced materials those of us hooked on swords know the Japanese were
already creating &quot;new materials&quot; hundreds of years ago that still
haven't been bettered. Back then it was flawless steel for <i>katana </i>blades;
today it's, say, gallium arsenide crystals for laser-driven semiconductors.
How, one might inquire, did all this expertise come about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>To stick to materials research, if you think a moment you
realize it's a discipline that actually must have begun in the latter days of
the Stone Age. &quot;High technology&quot; in those times meant figuring new
ways to use fire and clay to create something nature had neglected to provide.
Not integrated circuits, but a decent water pot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And the Japanese have been making terrific pots for a
thousand years. As it happens, some historians claim the very first Japanese pottery
was made in the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>province</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> of </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tamba</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>, near </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Why mention this? Because, then as
now, technology and politics had a way of getting mixed together in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, and Tamba was a perfect example. Tamba's artisans
made great use of a special oven known as a climbing-chambered kiln. Whereas
ceramics kilns elsewhere in the country were narrow and high, Tamba's
climbing-hill chambers were wide and low, thereby allowing the fire to touch
the clay directly. The result was a rugged, flame-seared stoneware that pleased
the manly eye—powerful earthy grays, burnt reds, greenish-browns, all with a
hard metallic luster. Thus Tamba was a locale much frequented by the warrior
shoguns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which may be why Tamba province has another claim to history
as well. It is the location of the one-time warrior castle- fortress of
Sasayama, once a regional command post of the Tokugawa strongmen in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. You won't find overly much about Sasayama in the
usual guidebooks, since it has the kind of history that's more interesting to
Japanese than to tourists. The place has no gaudy vermilion temples, no bronze
Buddhas ten stories high. Fact is, very little remains of the fortress itself
these days except for a wide moat, green with lotuses, and a few stone walls
lined with cherry trees that blossom an exquisite white for a few breathtaking
moments each spring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Although the castle is now burned down, a few homes of the
samurai retainers of its various warlords remain. If you stand on the rocky
edge of the moat at its southwest corner and look down through the cherry
trees, you'll see an old-style house built some two hundred years ago by the
twelfth <i>daimyo</i> of Sasayama for his most loyal retainer. Its walls of
white plaster are interspersed with beams of dark wood, its thatch roof
supported by the traditional ridgepole. Think of it as the home of the samurai
most trusted, the guardian of the gates, the warrior nearest the fount of
power.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Perhaps it will not seem surprising, therefore, that this
ancient samurai residence, in the shogun stronghold closest to ancient </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, was now home base for a powerful warrior of modern </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Matsuo Noda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Samurai had once battled in Sasayama's streets; many's the
time its castle had been stormed by raging armies; much blood had been shed and
much honor lost. But the event that occurred in Sasayama precisely two weeks
after Tamara Richardson's dinner in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>New York</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
was a historical moment more important than any in its thousand years prior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It began shortly after dawn, a cool September gray just
ripening to pink over the mountains. The early sounds of morning—birdsong, the
faint bell of the tofu seller, the steam whistle of the autumn sweet-potato
vendor—were only beginning to intrude on the quiet. Noda was where he always
was at this moment: on the veranda overlooking his personal garden, a classic
Zen-style landscape whose central pond was circled by natural-appearing rocks,
trees, bushes, paths. It was, of course, about as &quot;natural&quot; as those
sculptured hedges at </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Versailles</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. In order to create the illusion of
perspective and depth, the stones along the foreshore of the pond were bold,
rugged, massively detailed, while those on the opposite side were dark, small,
smooth—a little trick to make them seem farther away than they were.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It's a game heavy with nuance. For example, the stone
footpath on the left side of the pond may look as if it goes on forever, but
that's just part of the art: the stones get smaller toward the back, curving in
and out among the azalea bushes till they make one last twist and disappear
among the red pines and maples at the rear. Which trees, incidentally, have
themselves been slightly dwarfed, again enhancing the illusion of distance,
just as the back is deliberately shaggy and dark, like the beginnings of a
forest that goes on for miles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda's Zen garden, which deludes rational judgment by
manipulating all the signposts we use to gauge distance and space, appeared to
be limitless. The secret was that nothing actually ends: everything simply
fades out and gets lost. It was a closed space that seemed for all the world as
if it went on and on if you could only somehow see the rest of it. Yet peek
only a few yards away, and you've got the mundane streets of sleepy Sasayama.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This special dawn, as a few frogs along the edge of the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>pond croaked
into the brisk air, he knelt on the viewing veranda in a fine cotton morning
robe, a <i>yukata</i> emblazoned with his family crest (an archaic Chinese
ideogram meaning &quot;courage&quot;) and began to center his mind. He'd left
his </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> headquarters early Friday evening,
skipping the usual after-hours-drinking obligation of Japanese executives and
grabbing the eight-thirty San-in Express to Sonobe, where his limo waited to
bring him the rest of the way home. Now he was up before daybreak and readying
his usual morning ritual. As he sat there, gazing across the placid water
dotted with lotuses at the foreshore and framed with willows at the far
horizon, his silver hair contrasted with the marine blue of the robe to create
a presence easily as striking as the garden itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For a time he merely knelt, silently contemplating the view
and listening to the metrical drip of water from a bamboo spout situated just
at the edge of the steps. Finally he turned and picked up his <i>sumi </i>stick,
a block of dried ink made from soot, and carefully began to rub it against the
concave face of an ancient inkstone, till its cupped water darkened to just the
proper shade. When the fresh ink was ready, he wet a brush in a separate water
vessel, dried it by stroking it against a scrap of old paper, dipped it into
the dark liquid, and looked down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was the moment that demanded perfect composure, absolute
control. Before him was a single sheet of rice paper, purest white, and now his
hand held the brush poised. He was waiting for that instant when his senses
clicked into alignment, when the feel of the brush merged with his mind, much
the way a samurai's <i>katana </i>blade must become an extension of his own
reflexes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Although he would stroke only a few kanji characters,
scarcely enough for a telex or a memo, the moment required discipline acquired
through decades of practice. His Zen-style calligraphy allowed for no
hesitation, no retouching. It must be dashed off with a spontaneity that was,
in itself, part of the art. As with the swordsman, there could be no time for
conscious thought, merely the powerful stroke guided by intuition. No decision
that confronted him throughout a business day would demand half so much mental
control, inner resolve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just then, at the far end of the pond, the first sun
flickered through the wisteria. Suddenly, without his consciously knowing the
exact moment had arrived, as a Zen archer's arrow must release itself of its
own will, his hand struck. The dark tip of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>the brush
pirouetted down the paper, starting at the left and laying down a mere five
lines, twenty-two syllables.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He sighed, leaned back, and reached for the cup of green tea
that rested beside him on the polished boards. The verse was in an archaic
style, a few syllables longer than a haiku, modeled on an
eight-hundred-year-old work by a court poet of the Heian era. The strokes were
perfectly nuanced, the flow of the brush precise, the intuitive strength as
natural as a waterfall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda drained his tea, then rose to go back inside. His
antique house was tastefully &quot;empty&quot;: its <i>tatami</i>-floored
rooms, measured in multiples of those standard three-by-six reed mats, were
barren, a museum to times past. They also were open to each other, their
sliding doors, <i>fusuma</i>, being pushed wide. The walls, too, were vacant
expanses of white plaster with only an occasional mounted six-fold screen
depicting poetry parties of the Heian era, that courtly civilization portrayed
in The Tale of Genji. And there were no overhead lights, merely an occasional
cypress <i>andon</i> floor lamp to augment the pastel glow of the rice-paper
shop windows.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Asa-han</i>.&quot; He curtly ordered his gray-haired
cook to bring breakfast, then turned to mount the ancient stairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Hai</i>.&quot; She nodded and was gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Although he kept the lower floor exactly as it had
been two centuries past, the upstairs was a different matter entirely. It had
been converted into a high-tech office, hooked through a maximum security
TeleSystems TCS-9000 direct uplink (via the mid-Pacific Mareks-B satellite) to
the mainframe of his new NEC information management system in the Kyoto headquarters,
an augmented NEAX 2400 IMS, which handled voice, data, text, image. He had
scarcely flipped on the system when the woman who managed his kitchen appeared,
bowing, and deposited a tray bearing <i>miso </i>broth, rice, an uncooked egg,
and more tea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He grunted thanks as he was checking a CRT screen for the
current rate on Fed funds, the cost of the money American banks lend each other
overnight to meet reserve requirements. No surprises. Then he turned and
cracked the egg over his rice, adding a leaf of dried <i>nori </i>seaweed. As
he leaned back, chopsticks in hand, he quickly glanced through the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> papers, followed by The Asian Wall Street Journal and
the satellite edition of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>London</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s Financial Times. Finally he tossed
them aside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was always the moment when he liked to take measure of
the three photos standing in a row across the back of his teak desk. The first
was his deceased wife Mariko—long-suffering, deferential, resignedly selfless.
A model Japanese woman. He still thought of her with fondness, but as was
expected of a Japanese helpmate, she always ran a distant second in his
affections. His work came first.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The next picture was very different. This woman's face was
white, her hair a lacquered wig, her lips a tiny red pout. Her name, Koriko, had
been assigned years ago in the Gion district of Kyoto, and she was holding a
three-stringed lute, a samisen, and intoning some classical melody from
centuries past. These days she purchased thousand-dollar kimonos the way most
office girls bought jeans, but she worked for the money. She was a geisha, a
real one, an artist whose calling required years of training and commanded the
awe of even the most modern Japanese. Like a prizefighter or a matador, she'd
spent long painful hours perfecting style, technique, art. She had been Noda's
one-time protégée, beneficiary of his patronage. Now, though, she had other
&quot;patrons.&quot; He still missed her, but the memory was fading.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The third photo was a face familiar to all of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s avid TV viewers—Akira Mori. She was wearing a dark
blue Western suit, her hair a glossy pageboy cut, the conservative look of
times past. It was the occasion of her graduation from the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>School</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> of </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Law</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,

  color:windowtext'>University</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
(Tokyo Daigaku, or Todai as it's known), an important moment. Todai's alumni
represent a network, a <i>batsu</i>, of the country's ruling elite, who compete
with each other for the choicest, most prestigious government ministries.
Although she had chosen a more visible career, she still relied heavily on her
contacts in this governing clique, heads of the leading ministries, including
Finance, Foreign Affairs, and of course the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, MITI.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Matsuo Noda himself had, in fact, once headed MITI, probably </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s most powerful ministry. He came from ancient
samurai stock—fittingly perhaps, since the bureaucrats of modern </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> are mostly of that class. The samurai caste, men who
served a liege lord and were forbidden to engage in trade, were actually </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s first public servants. In between civil wars they
became sword-carrying bureaucrats. Many a modern bureau chief has ancestors who
wore two swords and sliced up a peasant or a merchant now and then with
impunity, which may help explain why the average citizen still views government
officials with such nervous awe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A Todai honors man himself, Noda was a natural for MITI,
which runs what is in many ways a covert operation. The head offices are in a
nondescript, soot-covered building of tinted glass and limestone near </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Hibaya</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Park</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
guarded by armed, helmeted members of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s
National Police. Inside it's mostly open floors and lines of gray steel desks;
no plush carpets and mahogany suites. MITI has twelve bureaus, each devoted to
a major industrial sector. If its officials decide </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s strategic interests would be served by a certain
manufacturing group's cutting production, lowering prices, altering product
lines, these &quot;recommendations&quot; are passed along. And it happens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda began his career there by circulating through the
different sections, &quot;going around the track&quot; as it's called, after
which he proceeded to run the General Affairs office of various bureaus, by
which time everybody had him picked for a mover, on the &quot;elite
course.&quot; Eventually he was promoted to section chief in the International
Trade Bureau, next on to bureau chief, and finally at age forty-seven he made
the top. Vice minister.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After he reached the pinnacle, he held the job for a mere
five years, then routinely left. He had to go; early fifties and you're out.
MITI is no country for old men. He moved on to head the Japan Development Bank,
JDB, where he financed various high-tech start-up industries. Finally he
retired and went out on his own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Unlike most other retired government officials, however, he
didn't accept any of the lucrative private offers he received, the suddenly
&quot;vacant&quot; spot on a conglomerate's board of directors. No, he had his
own smoldering vision. In a dazzling and successful departure from usual
Japanese convention, he</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>founded
Nippon, Inc., an adjunct to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s major financial players, with
headquarters in the commercial center of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
His new organization immediately became a financial fixture in the new
postindustrial, high-tech </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, and now, five years later, Nippon,
Inc. was a thriving force in the management of capital. These days even the new
generation at MITI routinely called him up for &quot;consensus.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For Matsuo Noda now, everything was in place; he was at last
ready to pursue a lifelong dream. He'd never forgotten the end of the war, that
last day on </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Okinawa</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> when Ushijima's 32nd Army was a
dazed remnant. He'd been in the cave above Mabuni when the general radioed his
farewell to Imperial Headquarters, then severed his own spinal cord. Matsuo
Noda, with anguish he could still remember, had burned the regimental flag and
told those remaining to scatter, to become guerrillas—repeating Ushijima's last
command to &quot;fight to the last for the eternal cause of loyalty to the
emperor.&quot; Noda had declared that their struggle would continue on for a
hundred years if need be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had overestimated the difficulty. The plan now poised had
required less than fifty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

publicly traded, had its stock faltered? What was the overview: securities,
un-amortized discounts on bonds, cash on hand? Next he paged through the weekly
updates from the Small Business Finance Corp., the National Finance Corp., the
Shoko Chukin Bank, various credit associations and savings banks. It was all on

financial centers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was about to ring down for fresh tea when a priority
override flashed on the screen for his eyes only. This meant a coded message
that could only be unscrambled using a special module in the computer. The </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> office knew he was on line, but they hadn't wanted to
route the information directly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Highly irregular.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He punched in the code, called up the receiving routine, and
waited for the message.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There had been a call from ship-to-shore phone, the
communications line linking him directly with Dr. Shozo Takahashi,
director-in-charge of his top secret &quot;project&quot; in the </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Inland Sea</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. The director was requesting that
Noda-sama contact him immediately via scrambler. Top security. He felt his
pulse begin to race as he digested the news.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It had been so easy. Almost too easy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He sat perfectly still for that timeless, historic moment,
gazing at the photograph of Akira Mori. A promise kept, from long, long ago.
Four decades now, and he had never forgotten what he had said he would do for
her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He called down for tea, waited till it had been delivered,
then punched on the phone and switched it to the security mode.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But even on the scrambler, Takahashi began circumspectly. As
the esteemed Noda-sama was aware, their &quot;project&quot; had, over its three
years, contended with great difficulties and many disappointments. They were
working at the very limits of undersea technology. As Noda-sama also knew, he
went on, their early attempts at seismic vertical profiling had been a complete
failure. Takahashi took personal responsibility for that. Next they had changed
strategy and utilized state-of-the-art microwave radar, hoping that minuscule
changes in density along the bottom might indicate what they sought. That too,
Takahashi apologized, had been unproductive from the start as Noda-sama had
been informed, and he, Takahashi, took full blame for the failure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda cut in at that point, impatient and wanting to
circumvent the litany of apologies. Why was Takahashi calling?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The director paused dramatically, then declared he wished to
inform the august Noda-sama that their latest approach, the use of a new
digital magnetometer, had at last borne fruit. Only this morning they had
detected and brought up an &quot;item.&quot; In the treacherous straits
east-northeast of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Shikoku</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. It was a water-tight gold case
embossed with what appeared to be a sixteen-leaf chrysanthemum or <i>kiku</i>.
The imperial insignia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Other confirming inscriptions? Noda nervously
reached out and clicked off the humming computer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, the formal script across one end appeared to be no later
than tenth century. Although they dared not open the gold case for fear of
damaging its contents, at this moment preliminary analytical procedures were
underway and the early results, including a makeshift attempt at shipboard
X-ray crystallography, suggested that the steel inside, which clearly showed
traces of copper alloy, contained less than a hundredth of one percent of iron
oxide. In short, it was possible the &quot;item&quot; might be perfectly
preserved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was theirs, Takahashi said, in that breathy, clipped
language inferiors use to signify great importance and great deference. It was
his extreme honor to announce to the esteemed Noda-sama that the most important
archeological find in the history of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
now belonged to Nippon, Inc., and they—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Chigau</i>,&quot; Noda cut him off, in the curt tone
expected of superiors. Incorrect: it belonged to its rightful owner and would
now be returned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And furthermore, he added, Nippon, Inc. had just ceased to
exist. Since the name for ancient </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
was Dai Nippon, &quot;Great Japan,&quot; as of this moment Nippon, Inc. had
just become Dai Nippon, International. A complete reorganization would begin
immediately.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally he ordered a total blackout. Radios silenced. No
shore leave for crew or scientists.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He clicked off the phone and repressing a tremble, descended
the stairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And there on the garden veranda, using a new brush and
perfumed <i>sumi</i> ink from his rare collection, Matsuo Noda composed a very
elaborate letter, long swirls of black down a perfect sheet of thick, flowered
paper hundreds of years old. It was then sealed in a silver case and hand
delivered by special messenger to a fortress in, the center of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span style='font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Five days later its recipient read it before a nationally
televised press conference, and </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
exploded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:1.0pt;color:windowtext'><img
width=33 height=33 src="images/image004.jpg" alt=""></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Kami wo araitai no desu ga. Ii desu ka</i>?” Tam
peered through the doorway and nodded hello to the girl in the blue Imperial
Hotel uniform. The hair salon was almost empty. Perfect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Hai, so</i>.&quot; The girl, startled at the <i>gaijin’s</i>
accentless Japanese, bowed to the waist. &quot;<i>Dozo</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Manikyua mo onegai shimasu</i>.&quot; What the heck,
Tam thought, why not go all the way, get a manicure too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Hai. Dozo</i>.&quot; Another bob as the girl ushered
her forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There was the plush, padded chair. Big, gray, and
voluptuous. She sighed and settled back. Heaven. Perfect peace in the middle of
hectic Tokyo. She knew that here for an hour or so she would be an honored
guest, smothered with attention. One of the most incredible experiences in Japan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While three of the girls began shampooing her hair, they went
back to chattering about the new husband a matchmaker had just arranged for the
petite assistant in the back. The bride-to-be was blushing and there were
plenty of giggles all around, hands over mouths. Tam realized, though, that the
girls were being a little circumspect. Who was this strange brunette <i>gaijin</i>,
speaking Japanese with no accent. Maybe she understood what they were saying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The woman who would become Tam Richardson was born Tamara
no-name in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kobe</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>, the somewhat embarrassing result of an evening's diversion
for an anonymous GI. Her mother, equally anonymous, had prudently given her
over for adoption rather than face the social awkwardness of raising a
fatherless, half <i>gaijin </i>child.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>She was eventually adopted by Lieutenant Colonel
Avery Richardson, U.S. Air Force, and his wife Mary, proud Iowa</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>stock, six
years after she'd been stuck in the orphanage. That was during the latter days
of the Occupation, but they'd stayed on in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
through '54 while Lieutenant Colonel Richardson served as adviser for the
rearming of what would be the Japanese Self Defense Forces. He'd also become a
Japanophile by then, so he left her in a Japanese school rather than subjecting
her to the &quot;army brats&quot; on the base. Finally they returned to the
States, with a dark-eyed little daughter who'd spoken Japanese for almost a
decade and being the achiever she was, read it virtually as well as a
high-school graduate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The thing she remembered best from all those years, though,
was one word. <i>Gaijin</i>. It wasn't exactly that the modern Japanese
consider <i>gaijin</i> inferior. They no longer dismiss Westerners as
&quot;red-bearded Barbarians.&quot; No, <i>gaijin </i>were merely unfortunate,
luckless folk not part of the earth's elect tribe. You were either born a part
of Japan, a full <i>nihon-jin</i>, or you were forever outside of it, <i>gaijin</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But knowing it was one thing, and living it as a kid was
something else. She wasn't one of them, and they made sure she got the message.
Finally, however, she discovered the hidden secret of Japan. Most Japanese get
very uncomfortable around a <i>gaijin </i>too fluent in their language or customs,
since that outsider has penetrated their life without the constraint of
relationships and obligations. No <i>gaijin </i>can ever entirely belong to
their seamless culture for one simple reason: no outsider could ever be held
accountable to the powerful social and family interdependencies that allow a
population half that of the U.S. to get along in a place functionally smaller
than California. So to survive there if you're not <i>nihon-jin</i>, you just
play that fact for all it's worth. Then, like everybody else, you've got a
niche; yours merely happens to be outside the system. As an almost-<i>nihon-jin
</i>you're threatening; as a <i>gaijin</i>, you're safe. She'd finally learned
this the hard way, from all those unsmiling little girls in blue school
uniforms who used to hiss &quot;<i>gaijin</i>.&quot; But thanks to them, Tam
Richardson learned to be a permanent outsider. And a survivor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, here she was again, ready for another bout. Round- eyed
&quot;Tama-<i>chan</i>&quot; all grown up and still on the outside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Though she knew Tokyo well from times past, she was still
trying to readjust. After checking into the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo's Hibiya
section, she'd showered, changed, and headed out for some jogging—the best way
she knew to see a lot of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>city quick.
Her major puzzle: where to look for the new impulse behind Japan's big drive,
their meteoric move toward the target of <i>dai ichi</i>, &quot;number
one&quot; in the world. Try to feel the vibes, she told herself, be a tourist
and see the &quot;New Japan&quot; through fresh eyes. If it had been winter,
she'd have gone straight over to Shinobazu Pond in Ueno Park to watch the
migratory Siberian waterfowl diving for fish among the clumps of floating ice.
In spring she would have first monitored the radio to find out which park had
the finest cherry blossoms, then gone somewhere else to avoid the sake-swilling
crowds. And if it had been summer, she probably would have headed for the cool
of the Imperial Palace East Gardens to catch the pink and red azaleas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Autumn, though, was a time for swallowing the city whole. She
started with the Meiji Shrine, that garish tribute to Japan's Westernization,
then moved on to the Imperial Palace, itself a place that, like Tokyo itself,
had something for all seasons. She passed through the East Gardens watching
provincial honey- mooners snapping pictures for the parents back home, then
worked her way across toward the Sakuradamon Gate so she could follow the
Palace moat as she made her circuit back to the hotel. Along the way she passed
the Diet Building and the Supreme Court, then decided to look in on the
Yasukuni Shrine, buried in its own exquisite grove of cherry trees and mixed
foliage. The massive bronze <i>torii </i>arch leading into the shrine was
always surrounded by stalls selling those marvelous little rice cakes, sweet
and leaden, she remembered as a kid. She stopped and bought two.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By then she was experiencing advanced jet lag, so she decided
to head on back to her crisp-sheeted bed at the Imperial. Tokyo this time
around was as impossible as always, maybe more so. Where do you start? The
garish Ginza, the self-conscious trendiness of Roppongi, the skyscrapers of
Shinjuku, solemn Marunouchi—all of it engulfing, awesomely materialistic. Each
trip the city seemed to get bigger, louder, more everything. More cars, more
neon, more . . . yes, more money. She could remember, almost, a time when this
town was a burned-out ruin. Now . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She needed some time to think, to work out a game plan. Sure,
clues to the phenomenon of modern Japan were everywhere—drive, self-confidence,
competence—but how did they fit together? Change was coming like an avalanche.
Who could keep track?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The best thing, she'd told herself, was to start with a clear
head. Back off for a while. After all, the last year had been much toil and
little play, with the latest book coming out, hassles at the university. She
needed some unwinding. Maybe a little time spent thinking about nothing would
be best of all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So for a day she lived off room service, immersed herself in
the local papers, magazines, TV, and just relaxed. She let Allan's hints about
some ominous new development slip way down the scale.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One of the things she couldn't help noticing, though, was an
odd stirring in the newspapers, something very much between the lines but all
the more real for that very reason. In typical fashion, signals were going out
that a major event was in store. The government, she knew, always used a kind
of early-warning system for important shifts. Very Japanese. If the Bank of
Japan was about to raise or lower interest rates, a move that would impact
thousands of businesses and banks, for days in advance various unidentified
&quot;officials&quot; would be quoted as speculating that maybe a change in
rates might be possible. Of course they didn't actually say it was going to
happen; they merely hinted it could be an idea to consider, it was plausible,
conditions might well warrant . . . Anybody with any sense knew immediately
this meant the decision was already made and citizens were being alerted to
cover themselves posthaste.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Consequently, if &quot;government sources&quot; start hinting
an event is conceivably possible, you can usually assume it's as good as fact.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But what was this about, she wondered, all these allusions to
a new &quot;interest&quot; of the Emperor's? The standard elements were all
there: leaks, guesswork, columns, unnamed &quot;high sources.&quot; No doubt,
something major was pending. And just to make sure nobody missed the importance
of whatever it was, there was even speculation His Majesty might actually hold
a press briefing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That last possibility, she decided, was clearly farfetched.
Just not done. A picture session, maybe, but that was it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After a day of unwinding, she was ready to get out and start
gathering some information. This time around, however, she wanted a different
image. A shift from the staid-professor look to high-tech Japan. Start with a
few clothes, something smashing/expensive/designer Japanese. And the hair.
Right. A cut, a different style, a something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thus around noon the third day she finally got into street
clothes and headed down to the lobby, then teeming with lagged-out Aussies in
funny tour hats. She took one look, ducked around them, then made for the lower
arcade and the shops.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And here she was. Already feeling recharged. Relaxed and … </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just then a short, excited hotel porter ducked his head in,
bowed, and announced he'd just heard that the Emperor was about to be on TV.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His Majesty? The salon froze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At first Tam thought the porter must just be playing some
kind of local prank. Arcade high jinks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she remembered the speculation in the papers. Could it
be true? She glanced at her watch; it was a couple of minutes before twelve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The girls immediately dropped everything and clicked on the
big Toshiba digital set suspended over the mirror. Service halted in midstream,
just as in a soba noodle shop when the sumo wrestlers on the corner tube had
finished glaring, thrown salt three times, and were ready to lunge. Then one of
the hairdressers remembered Tam and—maybe still believing no <i>gaijin </i>could
understand her language—reached down to snap on the small black-and-white Sony
attached to the chair arm, tuned to CNN's Tokyo service. It was currently
scrolling temperatures in the U.S.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now on the big Toshiba overhead, NHK (the government channel)
was announcing they were about to switch to a remote broadcast, live, from the
sacred Yasukuni Shrine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Uh, oh, she thought. Yasukuni! Has everybody here gone crazy?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Back before 1945, Yasukuni had been a memorial to the
&quot;master race,&quot; official home of the new &quot;State Shinto.&quot;
Japan's militarists had revised traditional Shinto, a simple nature- reverence,
to include violent nationalism, emperor worship, &quot;the Yamato spirit,&quot;
the &quot;way of the samurai&quot;: every warlike aspect of national character.
These days Yasukuni enshrined the names of Japan's two million heroic war dead,
a roll call recently enlarged to include Tojo and others the U.S. later
executed as criminals—which had turned the place into a political hot potato,
resulting in an enormous flap when the prime minister tried to appear there in
his official capacity. So, for the Emperor to show up suddenly, with heavy
press coverage, was almost unthinkable. Besides, she'd just been by the place
and hadn't noticed anything. This was very sudden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the remote came on. The front of the shrine was roped
off, right across the bronze <i>torii</i> gate, with only cameras and press
allowed inside. On screen was a shot of an elaborate new dais where an official
from the Imperial Household Agency, the government bureau that kept His Majesty
under its care and schedules his appearances, was just finishing up a
long-winded introduction. Then it was the prime minister's turn. After what
seemed half an hour of absolutely content-less oratory (a Japanese politician's
most respected skill) on the subject of the country's majestic Imperial past,
the PM finally stepped aside to allow a tall, strikingly handsome Japanese man
to approach the speaker's podium. Since the occasion had official significance,
his walk was ceremonial, with his feet wide apart in the jerky samurai swagger
necessitated in days of old by the two swords at the waist. Meanwhile,
everybody around him was bowing low.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His Imperial Majesty, wearing a formal male kimono,
equivalent to morning dress at Ascot, looked truly august. He was also carrying
a long silver box, filigreed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When he finally started to speak, the girls around Tam gasped
in astonishment. She noticed immediately that he wasn't using modern Japanese.
Instead, his language was an archaic, highly ornate dialect: the court speech
of long ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After his brief, almost unintelligible prologue, one of the
Household officials opened the box for him and took out a long, scrolled
document. The cameras did a quick close-up, showing a page of antique, flowered
paper inscribed with brush and sumi ink.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It turned out to be a letter in modern Japanese from the
president of a financial organization called Dai Nippon, International. As the
Emperor read it to the cameras, it began with a recounting of the loss of the
Imperial sword in the Inland Sea during the 1185 battle of Dan-no-ura. That
sword, it declared, signified Japan's physical link to a Divine past. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What? History 101 on TV?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then came the bomb.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Abruptly CNN cut into their normal late-night programming for
a live satellite report. Their reporter, grasping a mike and standing in front
of the milling mob around the podium, was reading from a press handout that
provided an English summary of the letter. Since the CNN signal was being
flashed to the U.S. and then back to Japan on the &quot;bird,&quot; effectively
circling the globe, it was a few milliseconds behind the NHK broadcast. She
turned up the sound.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2><i>. . . noon here in Tokyo, and at this shrine
sacred to all Japanese, His Majesty, the Emperor of Japan (Cut to shot of the
Emperor speaking. Reporter voice-over.) has startled the nation by announcing
that marine archeologists working for an investment organization called Dai
Nippon, International have just succeeded in recovering a famous symbol of
early Imperial rule. A three-year secret project in the Inland Sea, funded by DNI,
culminated five days ago when scientists brought up a watertight gold case
containing what is believed to be the original Imperial sword. (Cut back to
reporter.) Although no photos of the sword have as yet been released, we are
told it is in virtually mint condition. (Glances down to read from press
release.) According to the ancient Japanese chronicles, this sword was given to
Japan's first emperor by the Sun Goddess Amaterasu-Omikami, sometime around the
year 600 B.C., as a symbol of his divinity. Historians say it was later lost at
sea in the 1185 Battle of Dan-no-ura. That bloody naval episode, the subject of
much Japanese lore and tradition, marked the end of direct Imperial authority
here and the rise of the first shoguns, military governors who would rule in
his name. . . .</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She rolled down the sound. Who needed some English press
summary? She was watching the whole incredible event live as it unfolded. And
her first thought was: Good God, that's like finding Excalibur, or maybe the
Ark of the Covenant. Myth turned into reality. She glanced around the salon,
and already the electricity in the air was crackling. But what happened next
turned out to be the real news, the hidden agenda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After His Majesty finished reading the letter, he passed it</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>to an underling
and switched back to his ancient dialect. Now, though, his speech was being
&quot;translated&quot; across the bottom of the screen into modern Japanese.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He declared that since the Imperial Household, through the
loyal services of Dai Nippon, International, had had restored to it that which
it always possessed, namely the sword, he was pleased to honor the firm by
allowing it to construct a new museum to house the sacred symbol at a site just
outside Ise, home of the official shrine of the Sun Goddess. On his authority,
ground-breaking for the museum would begin immediately. However, until such
time as it was constructed and consecrated, the Imperial Household would make
the sacred relic available under heavy guard for viewing by the Japanese people
in a temporary showplace located at the Meiji Shrine in Tokyo. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By now shops had begun closing and the corridor outside was
in tumult. An excited young clerk from the flower stall next door burst through
the door and, bowing to everybody, lavished bouquets on all the girls. From the
streets above came a cacophony of sirens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But it still wasn't over. The most crucial part of all,
totally missed by the Western news force, was yet to come. After His Majesty
was bowed away from the microphone, another official stepped forward to
elaborate on the Emperor's remarks (probably because His Majesty would not
deign to mention anything so crass as money). As reward for restoring the sword
to His Majesty, he said, Dai Nippon would be allowed to serve as trustee of an
official, honorary investment instrument, to be known as the Eight-Hundred-Year
Fund. Acting for His Majesty, DNI would direct those monies into endeavors
&quot;commensurate with the nobility and ancient lineage of the Japanese
people, as symbolized by the sword.&quot; Then a telephone number flashed
across the bottom of the screen. The current subscription would be closed after
eight hundred billion yen were pledged. The president of Dai Nippon had asked
His Majesty for the honor of contributing the first billion yen personally.
Finally, in a quick aside, he added that interest paid by the fund would of
course be tax-free, as was normally the case for savings accounts in Japan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After a few closing formalities, interspersed with a photo
session of the Emperor and the president of Dai Nippon, the historic occasion
ended with a reverential shot of His Majesty being escorted to his limo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Who was that silver-haired executive, Tarn wondered. The man
was audacious, and a genius. He'd just turned the Imperial Household into an
accomplice in some kind of nationwide collection, using the Emperor for his own
ends much the way shoguns of old had done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But she sensed he'd touched a nerve that went very deep. A
fund in honor of the Emperor (that's already how everybody around her in the
shop was describing it), something in which to take pride, not just a numbered
savings account at the post office. Suddenly the girls and their Japanese
customers were all talking money. Here was something they could do to show
their regard for His Majesty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A line was already forming at the phone. The way she heard
sums being pledged, she calculated Dai Nippon would garner five million yen,
more than thirty thousand dollars, right there among the shampoos and curlers.
The typical Japanese, she recalled, banked over a quarter of his or her
disposable income. Little wonder most of them had at least a year's salary in
savings. At this rate Dai Nippon's &quot;Imperial Fund&quot; would be over the
top by nightfall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That evening NHK newscasts claimed it had been fully
subscribed in the first fifty-six minutes. After all, eight hundred billion yen
was only about six billion dollars, scarcely more than loose change to a people
saving tens of millions every day. It was, in fact, merely the beginning. The
next day more &quot;Eight-Hundred-Year&quot; funds were opened, by popular
demand. Soon the pension funds started to feel the heat, and a lot of
institutions began calling up. Yen flowed in a great river. All those homeless
Japanese billions knocking around the world had at last found a guiding ideal.
Some rumors even claimed the Emperor himself was actually going to manage the
money.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam couldn't wait to get outside and see firsthand what was
going on. This was something Allan could never in his wildest dreams have
predicted. As soon as she could get her hair dry she headed out; the girls
didn't even bother to charge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tokyo, twelve million strong, was in the streets. Even in
normal times the city could be overwhelming, but now . . . It was in
pandemonium, an advanced state of shock. As she struggled through the crowds a
lot of men were waving sake flasks, already gleefully smashed. The sidewalks
had become one vast <i>matsuri</i>, festival.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Something else, too. She found herself feeling a little
uncomfortable. There were glares, and then as she passed a withered old man
running a noodle stand, she heard him mutter &quot;<i>Gaijin</i>.&quot; What
did it mean?</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>What it &quot;meant,&quot; she reflected with alarm,
was obvious. The world had just become a brand-new ball game. Japan's
long-silent Emperor had once more spoken to his people, just as he had at the
end of the War. Back then he had broken two thousand years of silence to inform
his battered, starving subjects &quot;the war situation has developed not
necessarily to Japan's advantage.&quot; This time around he had confirmed
Japan's long Imperial heritage. The &quot;meaning&quot; was clear as day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This wasn't a new direction. This was just getting back on
track. Even though the Emperor had been humiliated and secularized after the
Great War against the threatening <i>gaijin</i>, his people still thought of
themselves as a single, pure family. For a time they merely had no focus for
that identity. Now they had it again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, she thought, why not? National pride. Not so long ago
we Americans had the Soviets telling us we were second best, so we blew a few
billion in tax money to plant a man on the moon and straighten them out. The
space Super Bowl. Why should Japan be any different? For years now they've
heard half the world claim they're just a bunch of hard-driving merchants with
a bank-account soul, when they knew in their hearts it wasn't true. Now here's
the proof, straight from the Sun Goddess. Time to get crazy awhile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the middle of all the bedlam and horns and sirens in the
street, she yearned for somebody to talk with, somebody levelheaded enough to
put this frightening turnaround into some kind of perspective. That's when she
thought of Ken.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Of course! He was Westernized; he took the longer view. Why
hadn't she thought of him right away?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So off she went for a quick surprise visit with Kenji Asano
at the Institute for New Generation Computer Technology, research headquarters
for the Fifth Generation Systems Project. He and his staff would probably be in
a holiday mood, just like everybody else. Maybe he'd loosen his tie and give
her a little off-the-record rundown of what this was all about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She knew the Institute operated out of the twenty-first floor
of a downtown Tokyo skyscraper. She'd been there before. She still had the
address, and the subways were clicking along right on time, though the fare
machines were off now in celebration. Half an hour later she was there. She
pushed her way through the milling lobby and grabbed an elevator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she rode, watching the lights tick off the floors, she
found herself wondering again what Ken was really up to. And what had happened
to Dr. Yoshida? However, it was hard to think about something as boring as MITI
and American defense vulnerability when people were whooping it up and passing
around paper cups of sake right there on the elevator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, don't jump to conclusions. This paranoia of Allan's is
probably just some grotesque misreading. Dr. Yoshida got promoted, and Ken's
merely filling in for a while till the Institute can recruit a new director
from some university. The work here's too important for politics. Intelligent
computers are Japan's lifeline—the &quot;steam engine&quot; of the next
century.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How would Ken react to her just showing up? After all, Kyoto
was two years ago. He'd claimed to be a widower, but was that merely conference
fast talk?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Best thing is just to play it straight, she told herself.
Strictly business. Let the rest fall out in time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she stepped off the elevator, she was relieved to see that
the offices were still open. Well, she thought, my first finding is that Ken
Asano runs this place with an iron hand, just the way Yoshida did. Total
dedication. Through floor-to-ceiling glass doors she could see the receptionist
at the desk, now excitedly chatting on the phone. Tam waved, and the smiling
woman immediately buzzed her through. Just like that. No different from the
last time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Doesn't look to be any MITI conspiracy here, she thought.
What exactly had made Allan so worried?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She bowed and handed over her meishi, her business card.</span></p>

color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Asano-san, onegai shimasu</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<h1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>CHAPTER SIX</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:1.0pt;color:windowtext'><img

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, why don't you just send your action over to the
'bean pit’ for chrissake?&quot; The phone line from Chicago crackled.
&quot;That's where the crapshooters are.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jerry, I wouldn't know a soybean if I ate one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hell, half of those loonies over there buying and
selling 'bean contracts wouldn't know one either. Come to think of it, I don't
know anybody over on the Merc who's ever even seen a pork belly. Do they really
exist?&quot; He was yelling to make himself heard over the din of the floor of
the Board of Trade. Futures on commodities were being bought and sold all
around him. Just then he paused, followed by a louder yell. &quot;Right, I'll
buy five, at the market. Yeah. I'm talkin' one and thirteen bid. What? You've
got to be kidding. No way.&quot; Pause. I could almost see the blue-jacketed
floor traders frantically hand-signaling each other. Then he yelled again.
&quot;Christ, Frank, I'm already long forty at sixteen. I'm getting murdered
here. You guys are killing me. . . . All right, all right, I'll pay fourteen for
ten. Yeah . . . Shit. Hang on, Matt. I gotta write this down on a ticket. . . .
Jesus, I should be selling Hondas like my brother-in-law down in Quincy. Sits
on his butt all day, screws his bookkeeper at lunch, and the man's making a
bundle.&quot; Pause. &quot;Hell, Matt, what'd I just say?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If I heard right, you just bought ten thirty-year
Treasury contracts at one oh one and fourteen thirty-seconds. You just agreed
to loan the U.S. government a million dollars, Jerry. Very patriotic. Except
you're probably going to turn around and unload the contracts in the next five
minutes to somebody else.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, yeah. Right. I should be so lucky. Christ, where's
my pencil? This place is driving me nuts. I think my mind's going. I've gotta
shorten up some here before the close. Hang on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        He
yelled at a runner to take his buy slip, then came back to the phone.
&quot;Matt, you're really shaking this place up, you know. Guys are starting to
back away. And the people upstairs are beginning to wonder. You've gotta think
about going off- exchange with some of this. Hit the market-maker banks. We
can't keep up with you here. I could try to get the Exchange to waive their
position limits, but don't hold your breath.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No problem, Jerry. My client's got plenty of other
accounts. We'll roll the next thousand contracts through a different one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Christ, whoever you're working for must have coconuts
the size of King Kong. You realize you guys're naked here? You're getting short
billions.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I just handle the orders, Jerry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your numbers scare the piss out of me just looking at
them.&quot; He sighed. &quot;Listen, Matt, take care. Get back to you tomorrow
at the opening. Right now I've gotta find some greenhorn to take a few of these
puppies off my hands or I'm gonna get blown out. Jesus, how'd I let myself get
this long at sixteen? Forty fucking contracts. And I was sure . . . Hey, gotta
run. Think I see some idiot over there signaling a seventeen bid. Kid must be
from Mars.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good luck.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right. Maybe I'll try prayer.&quot; He was gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd known Jerry Brighton since we crossed professional swords
once in the late sixties, and I'd never seen the man actually sit down. He gave
up law early, and these days he elbowed the mob in the Treasury bond futures
pit with the grim determination of a horse addict shoving his way to the
two-dollar window. If the bonds were sluggish, he'd roam the floor looking for
action. Football, you name it. He'd make up bets. Rumor has it, one slow day he
even set up a wager pool taking odds on which floor trader would be the next to
go broke, &quot;tap out&quot; in Exchange parlance. I'd guess Jerry's own
number was pretty low. A reliable source once told me Jerry'd averaged a
million a year for the past five, even while taking a hit year before last for
over two million when a certain famous &quot;inside trader&quot; sandbagged him
with a phony merger rumor. Maybe it was worth the ulcers. Thing is, I know for
a fact he'd have done it for nothing. A born market maker, right down to his
rubber-soled Reeboks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So when Jerry Brighton started complaining that Matsuo</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Noda's
action was growing too rich for his blood, I knew we were in the big time. It
took a lot to impress a pro like him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The thing was getting scary, but it was still perfectly
legal. Let me summarize roughly what had happened over the three weeks since I
had decided to play along with Matsuo Noda. First were the physical
arrangements. To accommodate my new calling, I'd enlarged my operating
space—the back room of the brownstone's parlor floor, looking out over the
garden— into a makeshift brokerage office complete with a multi-lined telephone
and quote services from S-tron and Telerate. I'd also installed a direct
tie-line to the T-bill pit of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, ditto the Note
and Bond action at the Chicago Board of Trade. And because of all the computer
hardware, I had to move Emma's desk out into the parlor. Consequently she could
no longer listen in on my calls, which she did not take kindly. However, I was
no longer forced to listen in on hers. I figure that sort of made us even.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In addition, I'd set up accounts at every futures brokerage
house in the land, both coasts, to spread out the orders. We were moving a lot
of contracts, and the big-time outfits like Salomon Brothers were scrambling to
make a market for us. Once again, therefore, nagging questions began to arise.
Anybody who'd thought about it for more than a minute would have realized you
can't make a play like Noda's without being noticed. There's no bigger rumor
mill than the financial arena. The very idea of shorting the bond market to the
tune of billions and remaining obscure and anonymous for any length of time was
absurd. After all, there're two sides to every bet. But since I was supposed to
be fronting his move specifically to throw sand in everybody's eyes, all this
attention presented something of a quandary. Although we were trying to keep
the lid on, buying small batches of Treasuries even as we were shorting them,
the price was softening and margin calls were starting to loom on the horizon.
None of this made any sense. Noda wasn't hedging or even speculating in the
normal sense; he was playing a giant game of cat and mouse with the markets.
This told me once again he wasn't showing all the cards in his hand. He had
something major, and unexpected, in the pipeline.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which brought forth the next insight: Matsuo Noda didn't hire
me merely because he wanted some innocent-seeming outsider to do his bidding in
the futures market; any number of players in this town could have handled that
action as well or better. No, he'd sucked me into his operation for some
entirely different purpose, at the moment known only to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But what? More to the point, why?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Welcome to Friday, and my rather disturbed life. Want to know
what really disturbed me the most? Seeing my new employer on CNN's Prime News,
standing there right next to the Emperor of Japan. Seemed as though I wasn't
the only one now under Noda's spell. All of a sudden my mild-mannered client
had become a world-class Japanese mover and shaker. And that made me very nervous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Needing a little perspective, I decided to invite down Dr.
William J. Henderson, respected thinker and booze hound. As it happened, he had
a little time to kill that Friday before his &quot;late date&quot; with some
advertising exec who was flying in from an assignment on the coast. Since three
weeks had gone by since our talk up at Martell's, it seemed like a good
occasion to get together and compare notes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>True to his word, he had formally resigned from the
President's Council of Economic Advisers, though he'd reluctantly agreed to
serve as a forecasting consultant for Wharton Econometrics. He'd also caused
some unsettling rumors in the world markets by putting on some very heavy
&quot;straddles&quot; in December gold futures and oil. He called it insurance,
predicting he'd be covered no matter what happened. Looked at another way,
though, Bill Henderson was quietly shifting out of paper money and into
commodities. And when </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> started hedging, you knew the
weather forecast was unsettled to stormy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It turned out he'd also uncovered a few stray elements of
what might well be a much bigger game. Nothing solid at that point, but enough
to stir him up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Know who runs that outfit you've taken on as a
client?&quot; He leaned back in one of the leather chairs in the upstairs parlor,
new pair of Gucci's glistening, and sampled his third drink. &quot;Guy by the
name of Matsuo Noda.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, who do you think I was talking to
up at Sotheby's the other night?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You check your wallet afterward? We're talking heavy
guns, my friend.&quot; He snubbed out what must have been his tenth Dunhill in
the last hour. &quot;You didn't tell me he was the honcho behind all
this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You didn't ask. Know anything about him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not till last week. I started to do a little checking
and first thing I know I'm stumbling across his name everywhere I look.&quot;
He studied the glass in his hand. &quot;Tell you something about this Noda. The
man drops a quarter, you let him pick it up himself. He'll nail you where the
sun don't shine. Definitely a bad news mother.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean that business with the sword?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nah, what in hell do I know about swords? That's your
toy box. I'm talking about the real world, friend. Turns out Matsuo Noda was
the prime mover in one of the biggest takeover plays of the century.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What takeover? They don't screw around with corporate
takeovers in Japan.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They don't take each other over. They take other
businesses over. Washington may think that war back in the forties is over, but
somebody neglected to pass the word to MITI. Seems they've got the idea it was
just the opening skirmish—the only folks who surrendered were the army and
navy.&quot; Henderson grew ominously serious for a change. &quot;Question is,
where's this thing headed? Is the idea of turning our industrial base into a
packaging operation for imports some kind of conspiracy, or is it just nature
takin' its course?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Conspiracy? That wasn't a word Henderson threw around
lightly. In fact, he tended to scoff at conspiracy theories, claiming they were
a substitute for hardheaded analysis. I agreed. So what was he driving at? I
pressed him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He paused to light a cigarette. &quot;I bring up this
unsavory possibility because I'm beginning to detect a little operation
code-named 'eat an industry.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Henderson, that's my game. I pitch in to help the
little fish fend off the big ones.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No offense, friend, but you probably couldn't even get
into the ball park where Noda and his boys are playing. We're talking the very
big leagues here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now hold on a second. Noda's not interested in
companies. He's just shooting a little craps. From what I've seen so far, the
guy seems to be completely on the up-and-up. In fact, looked at from the long
view, you might even say he's putting money into this country, never mind it's
just the Wall Street casino.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sure he is. It's like he first kicks the shit out of
you, then hands you a Coke so's you'll feel refreshed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What in hell are you talking about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, let's back up a notch. Since I don't want to
bad-mouth your new client, why don't you let me give you what I'll call a
purely hypothetical case.&quot; He sipped at his Scotch. &quot;Let's suppose
you were a Japanese guy, like Matsuo Noda for instance, and you wanted to take
over some strategic American industry and ship it to Japan. How'd you go about
it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well  . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have a drink, counselor.&quot; He plunged forward.
&quot;And let me tell you a little fairy tale. About how Matsuo Noda ate the
American semiconductor industry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Noda?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It was MITI actually. But Noda was running the Ministry
when they did it, and he was the guy who set up the play.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Noda ran MITI?&quot; This was news to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yep. Vice minister. Then he went on to greener
pastures, being the Japan Development Bank, and left the details to another
MITI honcho by the name of Kenji Asano. According to my sources, though, it was
Noda who handled the tricky part, the money, after he went over to the bank.
Got it together, laundered it, and dispensed it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Laundered it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can't think of a better word. MITI carefully made sure
the kickoff funding from the Japan Development Bank got passed through a shell
organization called the Japan Electronic Computer Company, hoping nobody would
trace it back to the government.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think you're starting to see things, but I'd like to
hear this little fantasy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, off we go to the land of make-believe. Once upon
a time not too long ago and not too far away, a few guys at Intel or Bell Labs
or some damn place got the mind-boggling idea you could shrink down a
computer's memory and put it onto a little sliver of silicon no bigger'n a
horsefly's ass. Various outfits tinkered around with the concept and eventually
it got commercialized. Lo and behold, Silicon Valley was born, where they start
turning 'em out by the bucketful. By '78 we're talking a five-billion-dollar
industry. Kids barely old enough to drink legal got so rich they just gave up
counting the money.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The American dream, Herr Doktor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That it was. Now, they were making a memory chip called
a 16K RAM, that's sixteen thousand bits of Random Access Memory storage. Orders
are pouring in, and they can't buy the BMW's fast enough out in Silicon
Valley.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know all about that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, there's more. Seems Noda and Asano and their
honchos at MITI had been watching this and thinking over the situation. They
decided, probably rightly, that whoever's got the inside track on these
computer chips has the future by the balls. Twenty years from now there's
nothing gonna be made, except maybe wheelbarrows, that don't use these gadgets.
So round about '75 they concluded they ought to be the ones in the driver's
seat. MITI 'targeted' integrated circuits.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, why not? We're the ones told them they were
supposed to be capitalists.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In truth. But just like in fairyland, our princess had
a problem. See, these chips weren't as simple to copy as an internal combustion
engine, or even a transistor. They're a heck of a lot more complicated. And to
make things worse, back when America was inventin' these silicon marvels,
nobody in Japan would've known one if it'd bit him on the butt. So it's a tall
order.&quot; He crumpled an empty cigarette pack and reached in his coat for
another. &quot;Now, imagine you're these guys in MITI. You want to take over an
industry you don't know the first thing about. How're you gonna start?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd probably begin by licensing the patents.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nice try, but you don't want this job to be too
straightforward. Then everybody'll suspect what's happening, and besides, it
wouldn't be as much fun. So if you're this guy Noda, you decide to set up a
sort of Manhattan Project, like </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
had to make the first A-bomb. You go over to see Nippon Telephone and
Telegraph, their AT&amp;T, and you say, 'Boys, we just decided you're gonna
pitch in with all you got. After that, you commandeer some labs at Toshiba and
NEC. Then you get yourself a batch of these little American gizmos and start
trying to figure out how the hell they work.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
poured himself another drink, then turned back. &quot;Now, since you need to
catch up fast, you do a little 'reverse engineering,' which means you steal the
other guy's R&amp;D. You take a bunch apart and decide you'll go with the 16K
RAM chip made by Mostek—a big outfit here that's since gone belly up, by the
way, thanks to our friends at MITI. And by 1978 you've made yourself a Mostek
clone. Bingo, you've got the technology.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think I'm beginning to get the drift.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Whoa, buddy. You're just starting to get rolling.&quot;
He forged on. &quot;By this time everybody's wanting these chips, so all of a
sudden </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Silicon Valley</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> can't keep up. Now you and your boys
at MITI are ready to move. You've got the know-how, so all you need to do is
start turning them out by the truckload. Of course that takes millions and
millions in plant investment, so you do what Asano did, bring your old pal Noda
back into the picture. Since he's now running the Japan Development Bank, he
obligingly lines up a whole shit-load of cheap money for these outfits gearing
up to chop </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s nuts off. All in all, he gets
together what amounts to a subsidy of low interest bucks to the tune of about
two billion dollars. All carefully laundered. Ready, set, go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Silicon
 Valley</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> glances up from
countin' its receipts and all of a sudden, from out of nowhere, here come your
Japanese chips. Reeeal cheap, since you've got all these cheapo 'loans' to
capitalize your plants. Inside a year you've got nearly half the market.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now, you figure somebody's surely going to blow the
whistle, so you can't believe your luck when </span><span style='font-size:
 10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Silicon Valley</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> thinks you're some kind of joke. Come on in, they say, and
sell as many of those crappy 16K models you can, since we've got ourselves a
hot 64K version cooking, and that's where we're gonna make our real killing.
When you hear this, you do a quick retool. And while the Valley is seeing how
sexy and expensive a design they can come up with, your thrifty gang back home
just sticks together a bigger version of that 16K chip you stole from Mostek in
the first place—and you're out front with a 64K. Now it's time for hardball, so
you flood </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> with these things. You drop the
price of your 64K RAM chips from thirty dollars down to half a buck when they
still cost over a dollar to make. Before you know it, you've got seventy
percent of the American market.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're selling at a loss. Dumping.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Exactly. 'Cause at this stage you don't care beans
about profit. What you're going for is the big fish, market share.&quot; </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> lit yet another Dunhill. &quot;And
sure enough, when it comes to the next generation, the 256K memory chip, you've
got ninety percent of the action. In very short order most of your American
competition folds. You ate them. Matter of fact, Intel, which started it all,
dropped out of RAM chips altogether—which is kind of like Xerox throwing in the
towel on copiers. This is less than a decade after MITI's start-up, in an
industry born in the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>USA</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Hi ho, silicon, away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But it cost a bundle.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Short term, sure, but now the future's wide open. You
live happily ever after, my friend, just like in fairyland, because big, bad </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s dead and gone in the high volume
end of semiconductors.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But MITI can't use dumping as a regular strategy. After
all, it is illegal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, now, ain't that a fact.&quot; He exhaled a
lungful of smoke and coughed. &quot;So's selling your ass. But just take
yourself a cruise down </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Eleventh
  Avenue</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and you'll meet
up with a lot of entrepreneurial ladies who understand the reality of market
forces. You've gotta get caught, tried, convicted. If it ever does get that
far, the most that's gonna happen is a fine. A lot of folks claim MITI's dumped
TVs, cars, steel, textiles, you name it. So when they decided to move on memory
chips, Asano was given a free hand to do it the quickest way he knew how. And
your buddy Noda ain't exactly a pussycat either, the way he laundered the
Japanese taxpayer's money into them low-interest, <i>manana </i>loans.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he returned to his Scotch, I sat there trying to think.
What </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> had just described was a fundamental
insight into how high-tech industries operate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, do you realize what you're saying?
That's a beautiful way to knock out a country's high-tech research capability.
Take away the volume end of an operation and there goes your cash. Pretty soon
you can't afford to finance any more R&amp;D. Which means that sooner or later
you're selling yesterday's news. You can kiss good-bye to your technological
edge, right across the board.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Correct. </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s
semiconductor boys were figuring to use the profits from memory chips to pay
for research in logic chips, where you put a whole computer's wiring on a chip.
But now the money's gone. What it really means is, end of ball game in
information processing. Maybe it won't happen tomorrow, but there's no doubt
it's just a matter of time. You dominate semiconductors, sooner or later you're
just naturally gonna control computer technology and all that goes with it. I
even met a guy a while back who claimed that whoever's ahead in computers is
eventually going to have the say-so about who has advanced weapons
technology.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Could be, I thought. But that last extrapolation was a
stretch. &quot;Bill, I think you're talking a pretty long line of dominoes. For
one thing, we've still got plenty of computer research here. The </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> has a big lead in logic chips.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;True, true. Who the hell can crystal-ball this one? All
I know is, Intel was claiming exactly the same thing about memory chips a few
years back, just before Asano and Noda and their pals chewed them up and spit
them out. All I'm saying is, you'd better watch your backside.&quot; He
examined his drink and reached for the ice bucket.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>About that time Ben came lumbering up the stairs to observe
our maudlin ruminations. I watched as he settled himself near my feet with a
grunt, then plopped his chin down on his paws.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, your fairy tale about MITI may or may not be
true. But that's water over the dam. Besides, who are we to be pointing a
finger? The </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> has done its share of tinkering with
foreign governments, making the world safe for American shareholders.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, I make a profession of separating pious
pronouncements from reality. I never take an official story at face
value.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, so Noda says he's just playing the market. But if
he's actually planning something else, then what is it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't have the foggiest. Wish I did.&quot; He glanced
at his watch. &quot;But I do know duty's about to call. I'd better get uptown
if I expect to have any female companionship for the apocalypse.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Take it easy. Nobody flies on schedule anymore.&quot; I
settled back into my chair and glanced up at the large Japanese screen I had
mounted on the wall opposite. It was Momoyama, around 1600, the time when the
most recent crowd of shoguns took over </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
Against a gilded background was a fierce eagle, perched menacingly on a pine
branch. The thing was so powerful I just kept the rest of the room bare;
nothing else I owned could stand up to it. &quot;You know, </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, the trouble with your pattern is that
it doesn't quite fit this time. Shorting Treasury futures is not exactly going
after an industry. So what's the new angle?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damned good question.&quot; He stared at his glass,
probably</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>wondering if
one more for the road would impair his performance later on. I guess he
concluded yes because he didn't budge. &quot;Speaking of angles, what do you
make of that sword business last week? Caused one hell of a flap in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, so I hear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Major event. That sword should tell us a lot about
early Japanese metal technology. I've been trying to find out more about it,
but nobody's talking. No pictures, anything.&quot; I reached over and gave Ben
a pat. &quot;Curious though. I think I remember Noda's mentioning that sword
the night I met him. Eight hundred years ago, the emperor gets caught at sea
and loses the imperial symbol. But he didn't breathe a word about having a
project underway to locate it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, you're my </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
expert. What's it all about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Never assume you understand the Japanese mind.&quot; I
pointed up at the wall. &quot;Take a good look at the eagle on that screen.
You'd think it's just a picture, but actually it's an important subliminal
message. The <i>daimyo</i> who commissioned this piece had that eagle put on it
to let everybody know he was cock of the walk. Means you cross him and you're
dead. Symbols are important in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Noda and this woman Mori talked a
lot about shoguns and emperors. Maybe they hope the sword will somehow bring
back the good old days.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, he's got enough money to do it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Looks that way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hope we're not about to get kamikazes with a checkbook.
Thoughts like that could make a man real nervous.&quot; </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> rose and strolled to the fireplace.
He examined his reflection in the large mirror over the fireplace, then set
down his glass on the mantelpiece and turned back. &quot;You know, Walton, I
think I'm starting to lose my touch. I don't believe anything I hear and only
half of what I see.&quot; He sighed. &quot;Been one hell of a day.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Pretty standard Friday, far as I could tell.&quot;'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, a damned strange thing happened this
afternoon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Some woman turn you down? Maybe you ought to start
working out, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, trim that little spare tire
creeping in around the waistline.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Still no complaints in that department, friend. No,
this actually goes back a ways, to a few months ago down in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Washington</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, when I bumped into a long-haired
professor coming out of a committee session. Guy I mentioned a minute
ago.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The linkup between computers and weapons?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Him. We got to BS'ing in the men's room, and it turned
out he was some computer hotshot from Stanford. He'd been testifying, I think,
and he was still wound up. Probably I got to hear all the stuff he'd prepared
and nobody'd asked.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What was the pitch?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Defense semiconductor dependency. Claimed that if we
keep on the way we're going, relying more and more on foreigners for advanced
chip technology, we may as well kiss the farm good-bye. I had a little time to
kill, so I invited him to have a drink. He good as chewed my ear off. Finally
had to fake a dinner date to get loose. Man had a bug six feet up his ass about
the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> buying half the latest chips for our
hot-dog military hardware from </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Next war we fight, says he, we'll
be buying high-tech weapons systems from the </span><span style='font-size:
 10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Far East</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. Problem with that is, anybody else could buy them too. And
we'd get replacement parts whenever MITI feels like getting around to it. Today
I happened to remember him, so I decided to give him a call, ask him if he
still saw things the same wav.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No answer at his office, but since I had his home number,
I decided to give that a try. Best I can tell, a lot of academics goof off half
the time anyway.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You get him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Some police detective answered, wanting to know who I
was, what the hell I wanted, whole nine yards. Shook me up, don't mind telling
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what'd your pal do? Rob a bank?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was about to start wondering. Finally, though, I got
to ask some questions of my own, but it was a little hard to swallow the story.
What I mean is, I don't necessarily buy what I heard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Which was?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, seems he was supposed to meet with the Senate's
internal security committee this morning. Wife says she put him on the red-eye
to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Washington</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> last night around ten. He was
carrying some document he said he wanted to hand deliver. Something about it
had him scared shitless.&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> paused. &quot;Tell you, this is the
kind of guy who takes security seriously. When <i>he’s</i> worried, we all
better be worried.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what's the problem?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:1.0pt;color:windowtext'><img

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ken looked terrific. That was Tam's first thought when he
walked through the high-security inner doors to greet her. He was square
shouldered and sturdy, with high, full cheeks, expensively trimmed dark hair,
and a small, delicate mouth. She figured him for late forties, early fifties.
Funny, but he'd always reminded her of one of those steely eyed, expensively
dressed actors you saw playing executives on the Japanese soaps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tamara!&quot; He paused abruptly, then bowed. &quot;<i>Ikaga
desu</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>ka</span></i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Okagesama de genki desu. Anata wa</i>?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Doing well, thanks. You never cease to amaze me. What a
marvelous surprise.&quot; A smile attempted to break through his dark eyes.
&quot;You've surfaced again, just like the Sword.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She'd forgotten how colloquial his English was. Then she
recalled he'd told her once about doing his doctorate at MIT. Possibly because
of that he could be either Japanese or Western, chameleon-like, as the backdrop
required. He was every bit the charmer she remembered from </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One thing was different, though. Kenji Asano was ill at ease.
He was trying to mask it, but it was there. And that was very different from
the old days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they passed the usual pleasantries, he led her down a
hall, then through a room where intense young men in open shirts were now
opening a case of Asahi beer. Computer terminals were in neat rows along the
walls, beneath gleaming white &quot;blackboards&quot; that sparkled with
equations and quips. The place was so informal, so . . . American. There were
plenty of jeans and frazzled sneakers among the forty or so young researchers,
most of them in their late twenties or early thirties. Plastered across the low
partitions were film posters and American counterculture bumper stickers (Radio
Already Stolen, Nuke a Commie for Christ); above a row of printers a blond
pin-up was unveiling her gynecological mysteries to the movie still of a
startled Godzilla; and a couple of rusty California vanity plates were hanging
over one long-haired staffer's terminal like big-game trophies—one read
64K-1ST, the other EZ BKS. Probably commissioned by venture capitalists in
Silicon Valley whose Porsches had since been repossessed, she thought. The rock
and roll dissonance of Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees sounded from a tiny stereo
assembled out of computer hardware and a new Yamaha digital tape deck.
Presumably as a stunt, the high end of the audio was being used to drive a
garishly tinted computer graphics display that had been projected against one
of the windows, creating a virtual image that seemed to dance amidst the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> skyscrapers like a Martian <i>son et lumiere</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>But she wasn't fooled by the frat-house trimmings.
She realized these casually dressed young researchers were the pick of Japan's
technical graduates. Making the Fifth Generation team these days was one of the
highest honors in the land. After some initial skepticism the big corporations
were now competing for the prestige of loaning their young stars to the project
for a few years, since they hoped to reap enormous benefits down the road.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In fact, the youthful atmosphere was entirely intentional.
That, she knew, had been the legacy of Ken's predecessor, Dr. Yoshida, who had
refused to let anyone over thirty-five on the project. Furthermore, since he
believed the stuffed-shirt layout of most Japanese offices and labs stifled
creativity, he had deliberately devised an un-Japanese workspace to try and
reproduce Western research environments.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally they reached a closed door. Metal. When she realized
it was Ken's office, she almost remarked on this departure from what she remembered
about Dr. Yoshida's well-known attitude. He liked to be out on the floor, with
just another low partition, right there interacting with his young staffers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without a word Ken inserted a magnetic card into the slot
beside the door handle and then pushed it open. Not only a door, she thought, a
locked door. Are they finally starting to worry about industrial espionage?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She wasn't surprised, however, to see that his office had a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>monastic
spareness, with only his desk, a small but expensive leather couch, and a row
of computer terminals along one wall. He was, she knew, a big believer in Zen
philosophy. Maybe pan of the reason for the door was just to shut all the
madness outside and keep his own world serene.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Through the window behind him she could see </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Mt.</span><span style='font-size:
 10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Fuji</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, outlined against a backdrop of
autumn blue. He smiled and pointed it out, saying they were lucky to have a
rare smog-less day, then gestured her toward the couch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Welcome to my refuge.&quot; He was cordial but entirely
correct—right down to his conservative charcoal gray suit. Not a glimmer of a
hint about their brief </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> episode. &quot;Let me have tea sent
in.&quot; He leaned forward in his leather chair and punched the intercom on
his desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, please, don't make a fuss. I know I hate it when
people just drop by.&quot; She glanced back at the locked door, wondering.
&quot;Tell me if this is not a good time for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, for you any time is a good time.&quot; He buzzed
again— there had been no response—then shrugged. &quot;I guess things are
getting hectic out front just now.&quot; He laughed resignedly, then turned to
her. &quot;By the way, I saw your new book. Fine piece of work. I do hope
somebody over there reads it. Are you still running your Center at NYU?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So far.&quot; She decided to spare him the details.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, it's a good school. Getting better all the time.
You've got some first-rate supercomputer work at the Courant Institute,
particularly with your IBM connection, but you should keep an eye on </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Columbia</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Now that AT&amp;T has joined with
them to go after some of the Pentagon's AI contracts, they may finally start
putting together a major computer science department up there too. In a few
years Stanford and Carnegie-Mellon will have to step lively to stay out
front.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hello, she thought. How come Ken suddenly knows so much
scuttlebutt about </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> computer research? Nobody at home
knows the first thing about what's going on in </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was surprised to hear about this new appointment,
Ken.&quot; She settled back on the couch. &quot;I was guessing you had the
inside track for MITI vice minister in a few years.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah, well, for now my work is here.&quot; He gestured
uncomfortably about the room. &quot;Let me try once more for that tea.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She realized he'd slipped deftly around her quick probe</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>concerning
MITI's new role in the lab. He knew how to be a team player, she thought. Very
Japanese.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This time he raised a response. A female voice dripping with
long-vowel honorifics announced his tea would be delivered immediately.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next came a small, awkward lull as they both sat there
remembering </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and not sure how to get around that
memory. She wondered if it was happening all over again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe it hadn't been just a fluke, a crazy one-night
diversion. She was about to switch to Japanese, thinking that might provide the
jolt needed to break the ice, but just as the silence swelled between them,
there came a knock on the door and tea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was half annoyed, half relieved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He rose to walk over and began chatting as though they'd been
interrupted in the midst of some intense technical exchange.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you scheduled to present a paper at that </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> conference coming up?&quot; He pushed a button beside
the door, and it swung wide. &quot;There's sure to be quite a crowd. Everybody
here's excited about supercomputers these days.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, this is strictly a pleasure trip. With maybe a few
interviews thrown in to make it a tax write-off for a book I'm planning on
robots.&quot; She hesitated. &quot;Though I actually might go down and try to
see a few people.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then this could turn out to be a pleasant
coincidence.&quot; He took the tea, and the bowing girl vanished. Again the
door clicked shut. &quot;I have to go too, but I'm hoping to steal a few
moments of freedom.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're chairing a session this year?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Absolutely not.&quot; He turned serious. &quot;I'm not
allowed time for anything like that anymore, Tam. This new project is top
priority.&quot; He poured her a cup of the pale green liquid and passed it
over, seemingly relieved that the tension had abated. &quot;There's a lot of
work here at the Fifth Generation lab now that we're coordinating this program
with the supercomputer effort.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean with MlTl's supercomputer project?&quot;
Caught your little slip, she told herself. You are still with MITI. Which means
they have taken over this lab.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He didn't blink. &quot;As you probably know, MITI has the
goal of creating a machine capable of a hundred billion computations a second,
targeted just down the road. Which means we have to come up with entirely new
computer languages and architecture.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Parallel processing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Exactly. Handling multiple streams of information at
once. Now that we finally understand what's required for a superfast computer,
this work in AI just happens to be very relevant. It turns out we humans are
already walking around with parallel processing in our heads, able to handle
words, images, ideas, all at the same time. So if we want to create machines
that operate as fast as possible, then it's crucial to understand how our brain
manages things like recognition, learning, inference. Our hope is that by
utilizing the studies here in those areas, incorporating them into our supercomputer
work, we might be able to put ourselves a major step ahead. . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good God, Tam thought, it's elegantly simple. That's why MITI
has taken over the Fifth Generation Project. They're going to use this research
in artificial intelligence to come up with a computer more powerful than
anything the world has yet imagined. Their silicon monsters are about to start
replicating themselves, getting smarter as they go, like in some bad fifties
horror flick. The difference is, this isn't make-believe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So you're here on behalf of MITI.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He paused. &quot;For coordination. As I said, MITI needs the
Fifth Generation work to be accelerated.&quot; He still hadn't exactly answered
the question. &quot;As part of our supercomputer effort.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam knew that </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Hitachi</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
and NEC were both already claiming they had the world's most powerful machines,
faster even than Cray's entry, the best American computer. What did MITI want?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He continued. &quot;With 16-megabit chip production already
going strong and 64 megabit commercialization in the wings, it did seem the
right time to pull all our work together. If you think about it, computer speed
and computer intelligence go hand in hand. I'll show you in a second what I
mean.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Not kilobit. Megabit. MITI was going for the kill. This was a
crash program. Why?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Does this mean you plan to increase your funding for
the Fifth Generation effort?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Whatever it takes to do the job,&quot; he replied after
a moment's hesitation. &quot;I suppose there's never enough money, is
there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, why the rush? This sudden drive?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It depends on whom you ask.&quot; He leaned back and
looked at the ceiling. &quot;Some call it survival, Tamara. Maybe it is that
simple. </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> is at a crossroads; we're rapidly
losing our edge in the cost of labor. The only possible way to counter that is
to step up our use of smart machines.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, it looks as if I came to the right place. I'd
like to add  your name to my interview list.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His look darkened a moment. &quot;Strictly off the
record.&quot; Then he smiled. &quot;And only if we can do it over dinner.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That sounds like a bribe.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Call it an offering from an old admirer.&quot; He
smiled, attempting to ease the tension. &quot;The most I can do, for now at
least, is just give you a small peek at a few of our experimental gadgets.
Details are strictly proprietary. At the moment we're concentrating on computer
vision and voice access. And on that last, by the way, I think we've just about
reached AI's Holy Grail, natural language comprehension.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good luck.&quot; That was one of the mythical dreams of
AI research, a computer that could understand the speech of anybody who
happened along. Even though millions had been invested in the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> nobody was anywhere close yet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think we're getting there. Enough so in fact that
we're starting to look at applications. Expect commercialization in, oh, say a
year, two at most.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Look out IBM, she found herself thinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I probably shouldn't be showing you this, Tamara. So
let's just keep this informal. No notes. But here, have a look at one of MITI's
new toys. Can you guess what this is?&quot; He passed over a small device that
had been sitting on his desk, his hand lingering on hers a moment longer than
absolutely necessary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stared down at what appeared to be some kind of
calculator-watch, except there was no watch face, merely a small speaker and
two buttons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That uses advanced versions of MITI's new 64-megabit
memory chips. There's nothing like it anywhere in the world. Without ever
having heard the speaker's voice before, no calibration, it can translate
ordinary spoken English into Japanese.&quot; He pointed to one of the buttons.
&quot;Just press there</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>and talk.
When you finish, push the other button for the translation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She did, testing it with the opening paragraph of Pride and
Prejudice, her favorite novel. A simulated voice emerged from the small speaker
on the face of the device and gave it back . . . in flawless Japanese.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not bad.&quot; She set it carefully onto the desk. The
thing was actually almost frightening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Using this, linked to our new high-definition video and
satellite, you could punch a button in your living room and bring up people on
a wall-size screen from anywhere in the world, then talk to them in your
language and be understood in theirs. It's a quantum advance over current
technology.&quot; He retrieved the device, dropping it into a desk drawer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I must admit I'm very impressed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Truthfully, so am I. Where's this program of MITI's
taking us?&quot; He looked up. &quot;But let me show you something else, which
I think is even more astonishing. Of course you're aware that speech
comprehension is easy compared to the really tough nut, duplicating the human
eye. Since a visual image can contain billions of pieces of information, it can
be very time-consuming for a computer to analyze all those at once and figure
out what it's looking at. I've heard people at IBM claim that for a computer to
recognize something even as simple as an odd-shaped coffee cup would still
require almost an hour of processing, that to match the human eye and brain
could take a computer the size of a building. But watch.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He walked over to a black metal installation attached to the
wall and held up three fingers before its small lens. Then he pushed a button
and spoke into a built-in microphone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you see?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She started to reply herself, then realized he was talking to
the lens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This time the answer took about ten seconds. Finally a voice
in passable simulation of the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> dialect emerged from a gray speaker
beneath the lens. &quot;That is a human hand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How many fingers does this hand have?&quot; he
continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Again the eerie, disembodied voice. &quot;The normal human
hand has five fingers. This appears to have only three.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thank you.&quot; He punched a button and turned back.
&quot;That came off the mainframe here. Can you imagine the amount of memory
and logic processing required to achieve what you've just witnessed: the data
base and the computational power and speed? Not to mention the recognition of
my voice commands.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How does it do it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He paused. &quot;Tam, this is proprietary, top secret, but
what you've just witnessed is an example of parallel processing with MITI's
new, still classified 256-megabit dynamic RAM's.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A quarter of a billion bits of data on a chip.&quot;
She just stared. &quot;Are they writable?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course.&quot; He again settled himself behind his
desk. &quot;The test versions have circuits only a hundred or so atoms wide.
And this is only the beginning. Within five years, maybe no more than three,
MITI fully expects to have a desktop machine that will pass the Turing
test.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Three years?&quot; It was almost unbelievable. Passing
the &quot;Turing test&quot; meant the computer's &quot;thoughts&quot; and
&quot;speech&quot; would be so lifelike you'd be able to talk with it and not
realize it wasn't human. Al's end-of-the-rainbow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you can see, the project is getting close.&quot; He
looked pensive, like some Zen monk. &quot;Strictly off the record—and I mean
that—what MITI is working toward is total automation. Factories run by machines
with human skills, intelligence, manual dexterity. In fact, several of the
robotics labs at </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tsukuba</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Science</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
 </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>City</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> already have prototypes in advanced
stages of development.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was stunned. This was the kind of futuristic talk you
heard from all the AI buffs, but it was still mostly speculation in the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Europe</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
though, was taking it straight to commercialization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why are you telling me all this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He sat silent for a moment. Then he looked at her.
&quot;Because it's time the world understood something very important about
this country. There are people here . . . with an agenda. And resources.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, there are people, important people, who are
getting fed up. Know what they're saying? Try this. Our country has a monarchy
older than </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Rome</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, a heritage of literature, art,
aesthetics, equal to anything in the West. We've never had any colonies, any
raw materials besides air and water. All we do have is a willingness to work
and save—the one natural resource running short in the West. In less than half
a century we've risen from the most total devastation any country has ever
experienced and achieved technological parity with both the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and the Soviets. We launch satellites, split atoms,
splice genes. But still a lot of foreigners claim all this country can do is
copy from the West, steal and commercialize other nations' inventions. Only a
short time back the leader of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>France</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> called our prime minister a
'transistor salesman.' That's right. A 'transistor salesman.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, that stupid crack was by de Gaulle. Years ago.
It's—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, look around you. This is an old country. And a lot
of influential people have long memories.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're getting melodramatic.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He shifted in his chair and studied the white </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>peak</span><span style='font-size:
 10.0pt;color:windowtext'> of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Fuji</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. &quot;Think so? Don't delude
yourself. Believe me, the West is about to dig its own grave.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you trying to tell me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing you can't see with your own eyes.&quot; He
turned back. &quot;MITI is now ready to move into the next phase. Finally
here's a project that's as strategic, in its own way, as the bomb. If </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> can succeed in creating a machine capable of
humanlike thinking, it will be the most profound achievement in the history of
mankind.&quot; And this project is well on its way. There may be nothing that
can stop the events that lie ahead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stop what? What events?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's not a simple question.&quot; He caught himself
and eased up, smiling uncomfortably once again. &quot;Forgive me. None of this
is for publication.&quot; He hesitated. &quot;Your work is well-known here in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, Tam. You are one of the few Americans our
industrialists respect unreservedly. Maybe you weren't aware of that. Your
books are highly regarded; in fact, I read the new one in manuscript.&quot; A
long pause, then, &quot;Would you ever consider working with me for a while?
Come back home, so to speak? You can see the implications of this
project.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I see the implications, all right.&quot; She didn't
know what to say. Why a sudden job offer from Ken? Or was it from MITI?
&quot;But where is this headed? If </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
achieves this technological supremacy, what then?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Before the flowers bloom, MITI must tend the
garden.&quot; He rose and poured more tea into her cup. &quot;But enough. You
know, I've thought about you a lot. Tell me how you've been. What've you been
doing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Teaching, writing, you know. Everything and
nothing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He smiled, then brushed an imaginary fleck of lint off his
tailored woolen cuff. &quot;Well, perhaps we'll have some time to talk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What was he driving at? Was there more? Something going on he
didn't want to broach here in the lab?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, it is so good to see you once more.&quot; He
looked up again. &quot;Would you be interested in going down to </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> with me day after tomorrow? There are some things . .
.&quot; He sipped at his tea. &quot;As I said, I'm scheduled to look in on the
conference and see a few people, but I should have some free time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That conference doesn't start till next week.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Actually I need to be down a few days early.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> &quot;Oh. Why?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He measured his words. &quot;Oddly enough it has to do with
the Sword. Things have started moving pretty fast since those archeologists
working for Dai Nippon recovered the sacred Sword-of the Emperor Antoku.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I saw the Emperor on TV. Try going outside now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I think I'll close here a little early and let my
people go on home. It sounds like their celebration has already started
anyway.&quot; He gestured toward the music and noise filtering through the
door. &quot;But the reason I need to be in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
a few days in advance is to see the president of Dai Nippon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The firm that—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's right. His name is Matsuo Noda. I've known him
for some years actually. He contacted me a couple of days ago about a meeting.
I'm not sure what he has in mind precisely, but I have to find out. He's just
become one of the most influential people in the country, not that he wasn't
already. And now with all the money he's about to have in this new Imperial
fund . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The one mentioned at the Emperor's news
conference?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Exactly. As you might suspect, that was merely the
formal announcement. Some of us at MITI heard about it several days ago. My
private hunch is that in a few days Matsuo Noda could well have more resources
at his fingertips than any one man in the history of the world.&quot; He looked
at her. &quot;It's almost frightening when you think of the power he'll soon
have.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, I think I would like to come along with you.&quot;
What was going on? MITI's plans already were pretty astonishing. And now this
new national hero, the president of Dai Nippon, was about to get involved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>More than that, she'd half forgotten how interesting Kenji
Asano really could be. Her trip was taking a lot of unexpected turns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, then, in that famous American phrase, 'Why
not?'&quot; He smiled, the mask firmly back in place. &quot;In fact, I'll try
and arrange for you to meet Matsuo Noda while we're there.&quot; A
conspiratorial wink. &quot;Maybe he'll even give us a glimpse of the
Sword.&quot;</span></p>

was one big party that night, the streets mobbed. They eventually found
themselves in Shinjuku, in a high-tech new restaurant all chrome and glass and
New Age prices. The tuna sashimi seemed only minutes from the sea, and the aged
sake was smooth as a flawless white </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bordeaux</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
Afterward they grabbed a taxi over to the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>Ginza</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
where Ken got seats on the tatami straw mats down in the orchestra of the
Kabukiza, and they took in the last act of a Kabuki play (featuring the famous
Ennosuke III) that had been underway since late afternoon. The evening ended up
in the art deco mezzanine bar at the Imperial, the part salvaged from the old
Frank Lloyd Wright structure, where she kicked off her shoes, ordered a
twenty-dollar cognac, and nestled against his elegant shoulder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What was that he'd said about coming back home? Her books
being circulated here even in manuscript? What was he hinting at?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

elevator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She thought one last time about Allan's warning as she
watched the floors flash above the door and searched for her key. But this was
no time to brood about conspiracies. Ken made her feel good. Which was a hell
of a lot more than Dave Mason had done. Besides, Ken had some style; all Dave
did was mope around in a pair of baggy chinos and whine about his department.
Ken was upbeat, alive, aware.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What's more, she enjoyed being with him, feeling the heat of
his cheek against hers. As the elevator doors opened, he slipped an arm about
her waist and nuzzled her hair. Then their lips met.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was just as she remembered. His touch, his taste, his
body. Still, something about him was definitely changed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he reached for her key and opened the door. The minute
they entered the sitting room of her suite, he took her in his arms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, let's not talk anymore about business, no more
Swords. I'm already bored hearing about it. Just us. What do you say?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Agreed.&quot; She looked at him and suddenly realized
something. Ken Asano was beautiful, <i>kirei</i>. Not handsome, beautiful. <i>Anata

Remy in my—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who could even think about another cognac. I just want
to think about us.&quot; He stood back. &quot;All right, maybe if you insist.
For old times' sake.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;'Old times' is right, Ken. It's been a very long time
since </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.&quot; She located the dark Remy
bottle, still packed in her leather flight bag. A nice inauguration, she told
herself. &quot;What was that all about? Was it real? Or did I just imagine it
all?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The heart never lies.&quot; He settled on the couch.
&quot;Do you really remember?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Vividly.&quot; She laughed as she poured an inch into
each of two thin hotel tumblers. &quot;Including that dreadful bar you took us
all to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A glimpse of the real </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>, Tam, for our tourist friends. Show them it's not all <i>ikebana</i>
and <i>haiku</i>. Believe me, it's not.&quot; He clicked her glass. &quot;Do
try to forgive me. And here's to us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And to the slightly scary world we're stumbling into. </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> needs you here.&quot; He pulled her next to him and
brushed her cheek lightly with his fingertips. Then he kissed her deeply on the
mouth, and again. &quot;/ need you here, Tam. Somebody like you. There's . . .
well, there's a lot we could do together.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She reached up and loosened his tie, then began unbuttoning
his shirt. His chest was firm, smooth, scented. She wanted him. &quot;Let's
just remember </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> for a while.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've never forgotten it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sometime around </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

more content than she had been in a long, long time, Tam Richardson lay awake

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Back in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New
  York</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, optimism was in
increasingly short supply. What do you do if you think you're being set up? One
thing, you may have occasion to muse long and hard about the consequences,
personal and otherwise. You also may choose to ponder the larger motives of the
individual behind it all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So far, what had happened? Matsuo Noda had hired Matt Walton,
corporate attorney-at-law, to begin shorting the American Treasury market, then
proceeded to make himself a bona fide hero back home, in the process of which
he acquired access to the biggest chunk of savings in the world, presumably the
&quot;financial arrangements&quot; he once alluded to. Using that money as
margin, Noda was ready to shift his play into high gear. My latest telexed
instructions indicated he was poised to accelerate dramatically,
&quot;borrowing&quot; bonds and selling them for whatever the market would pay.
Of course if the price went down anytime soon, he could then replace those
borrowed instruments at some fraction of what he'd sold them for. The man was
gambling, for godsake. With the &quot;Emperor's&quot; fund.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or was he? Therein, as somebody once said, lies the rub.
Short selling has always been a reasonably good definition of gambling, except
. . . except you are gambling only if you are wagering money on an event whose
outcome is not precisely known. If you do know it, you are not gambling. You
are taking prudent steps that will allow you to benefit from prior knowledge of
said, etc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Enough airy semantics. The big question: Why me? Now, I've
been set up a few times before in my life. Everybody has. I even wonder in
darker moments if the reason Joanna demanded a champagne lifestyle wasn't to
make sure I spent all my time supporting it, thereby rendering me exactly what
she eventually accused me of being—an absentee husband and father. That is a
no-win situation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The undertaking at hand, however, could have a very obvious
beneficiary. Matsuo Noda. The only problem was that in order for Noda to win, </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> had to lose. Massively. The old
zero-sum game: for every winner there has to be an equal and opposite sucker.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After that Friday evening with </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>, I spent the next week mulling over the complexities of the
situation. The whole thing boiled down to two very strong presumptions: one, I
was indeed being set up, being told one scenario while the truth lay in quite
another direction; and two, my employer had something very lethal to America's
financial health up his sleeve. Still, these were merely presumptions, nothing
more. The only thing I was sure about was that I had a very unpredictable tiger
by its posterior handle. Time to find out a little more about my pussycat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I hadn't actually seen Dai Nippon's midtown office, but I
talked to the manager almost every day on the phone, and he occasionally
shipped materials down to my place in the Village. I knew they'd taken over the
building, installed a new security staff, moved into the vacant floor, and were
doing something. However, I hadn't been invited up to see what the something
was. I concluded the time was at hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I understood it, Dai Nippon's purpose in life was to
oversee the use of investment capital. Fair and good. As it happens, Japanese
business tends to be funded a little differently from our own. Instead of
selling off stock to the public, Japanese industry relies much more heavily on
bank financing. In fact, less than twenty percent of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s industrial assets are publicly traded. Consequently
the rules of the game are changed. If your company is beholden to a financial
institution instead of a lot of nervous stockholders and fund managers, you're
in partners with somebody less interested in next quarter's profits than in the
larger matter of your still being around ten years hence to pay off its paper.
That lender naturally rides herd very closely on your long-term planning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As best I could tell, DNI was one of the herd-riders, a sort
of hired gun that monitored various companies' operations to make sure they
were managing their loans prudently. Again, since the prospectus emphasized
they were specialists in overseas investment, I assumed that maybe part of the
reason they were coming to the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> was to oversee the Japanese
companies doing business here with money borrowed from back home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nobody had actually told me this. In fact nobody had told me
anything. That was merely what I considered to be an educated guess. It was the
only thing I could think of that made the slightest sense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The following Monday morning I told myself the guesswork was
over. It was high time I went up and saw for myself what they were doing. All I
needed was an excuse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the phone rang. I was in the garden out back, skimming
the Times and working on a pot of fresh coffee while waiting for the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Chicago</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> exchanges to open. Ben was cruising
the fence line, sniffing for cats.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I picked up the receiver, waiting at the other end was
Mr. Yasuhiro Tanaka, office manager for the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>New York</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
operation. He chatted a bit about the weather, how nice it was to be working in
the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, the usual. Finally he mentioned
that he needed to meet with me to discuss, among other matters, certain legal
questions concerning one of the other leases in their building. Would it be
convenient if he came down to my place and we went over the paperwork?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Not necessary, I replied. I just happened to be headed for
midtown in the next few minutes. I'd throw a copy of the leases into my
briefcase and drop by to see him. Then before he could protest, I mumbled
something about the doorbell and hung up. The phone rang again immediately, but
I didn't answer it. I was already putting on my jacket.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I scribbled a few notes for Emma, taped them to her word
processor, and headed out the door. Minutes later I was in their </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Third Avenue</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> lobby, greeting the new security
staff, several of whom, as a favor to Tanaka, I'd interviewed for their jobs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I took the elevator up to DNI's offices on the eleventh
floor and proceeded to have my argyle socks blown away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>First off, top security. The entryway just off the elevator
bank had been completely transformed. TV intercom, steel doors—it could have
been the vault at Chase. I told the camera's eye who I was and then waited
while a computer somewhere gave me a voice-ID check. How they managed to have
me in the system already I wasn't exactly sure . . . maybe they'd taken it off
the phone?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After I'd cleared that, the doors slid open and I entered the
first chamber of a two-room security check. An electronic voice ordered me to
put my briefcase into the X-ray machine while I proceeded through the metal
detector.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That cleared, the set of steel panels leading into the next
room slid open and I went in . . . to be confronted by two crew-cut guards who
could have been retired sumo wrestlers. As the doors clicked behind me, I took
one look at DNI's welcoming committee and realized they were packing Uzis,
those Israeli automatics that could probably cut down a tree in about two
seconds. No candy-ass .38's for Dai Nippon. Without ceremony they commenced a
body search. It was all very polite, but it sure as hell wasn't perfunctory. I
just stood there in astonishment while this gorilla roughly twice my size felt
me up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That indignity completed, I was now in line for the real
surprise. Yet another set of steel doors opened, and there awaited the man I'd
been dealing with over the phone, Yasuhiro Tanaka. Medium build, late forties,
cropped hair, automatic smile—he was Noda's chief of operations for </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. He didn't say much, just led me
onto the floor, heading for his office. But he was clearly the on-site daimyd:
lots of heavy bowing from the young, white-shirted Japanese staff as we headed
for the corner suite.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which brings us to the real shocker. Dai Nippon's floor
operation looked like the flight deck of the Starship Enterprise. Let me
attempt a brief description. In the far back was a massive NEC augmented
supercomputer—a half dozen off-white octagonal units about head high, one the
mainframe and the others storage modules arranged alongside in a neat row. Pure
power. The whole thing was encased in a glassed room with (I assumed) critical
temperature and humidity control. Then out on the floor were lines and lines of
workstations. Computer screens everywhere, printers running, stacks of color
hard copy—pie charts, bar graphs, spreads—plus terminals carrying every
financial service offered by cable or satellite.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was just the first, five-second glance. Incredible, I
thought. There must be a heck of a lot more Japanese investment in the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> than anybody realizes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But something had to be wrong here. Why should . . . ?
Finally I slowed down—Tanaka was hurrying me along, clearly</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>annoyed that
I'd appeared uninvited. That's when I noticed the rest. Across one wall was a
line of projection TVs, on which computer data was being scrolled. As we walked
past, I noticed that each screen seemed to be under the scrutiny of a team of
analysts, who were intently studying the numbers, comparing notes, running
calculations on their individual terminals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What's this all about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I stopped before one screen and studied it a second. Beneath
it a small sign said simply &quot;Electronics.&quot; The one next to it read
&quot;Biotechnology.&quot; Then I glanced at a couple of others. Each one
covered a different industrial sector. Gee, I thought, you're really out of
touch, Walton. Who would have guessed </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
has so much investment in manufacturing here. I didn't remember much going on
besides a few joint ventures. Sure, they've got a few auto assembly plants,
that steel plant they'd bought out on the coast, some TV-tube production,
chips, VCRs. But mostly it represented entries into sectors where they're
trying to get the jump on protectionism, start a token manufacturing operation
here before they get shut out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you have any questions, I'm sure we can discuss them
later.&quot; Tanaka had taken my arm and was urging me politely toward his
office. The whines and hums of laser printers and the beep of computers made
conversation all but impossible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I was merely interested . . .&quot; Then I
stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Know that test psychologists have, the one where you look at
a couple of silhouettes and describe what you see? If you think you're supposed
to look at the white part in the middle, then you see one thing—I think it's a
vase. But if you concentrate on the black instead, you see something else
entirely, maybe the profiles of two human faces opposite each other. Thus what
you see is largely a product of your prior assumptions concerning what you're
supposed to be looking for. Or maybe it measures whether you view the world as
a positive or a negative image, something like that. I don't recall exactly. I
do remember receiving a B- in Psych 101, which was generous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The point is, what I first thought I saw was actually the
inverse of what was really there. I'd told myself what it was, rather than
believing my eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dai Nippon was running analyses, bet your ass, but the
industries under their silicon microscope weren't Japanese.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>They'd
computerized the financial report of every American company traded publicly and
were now in the process of taking those outfits apart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And I can assure you it was cold-eyed in the extreme,
strictly hard numbers: quarterly earnings, long-term debt, inventory, stock
outstanding, CEO bonuses. As any professional analyst would do, they'd cut
right through a company's glossed-over excuses, phrases such as strategic
retrenchment, aimed at the dividend-nervous retirees in Cedar Rapids. They were
putting together the real story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Same with the financial markets. Screens were scrolling up-
to-the-second quotes on everything from three-month T-bills to thirty-year
Treasury bonds. Computers were running arbitrage spreads on every issue. They
knew exactly where they stood with all their futures contracts. I realized my
little telephone boiler room had merely been the tip of some awesome iceberg.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton, it is a pleasure to meet you in
person.&quot; Tanaka was ushering me into the corner office after our pass
through the floor. Unlike most executive suites in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, its windows were sealed with heavy
drapes. Again, total security. &quot;Let me order tea.&quot; He waved at
somebody out on the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I nodded, still chewing over the setup and trying to
understand what in good Christ was underway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm sure you are a busy man, so perhaps we should
proceed directly to my concerns. As you may have guessed, we are almost ready
to move into a new phase of our operation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh.&quot; I guess it must have sounded dumb, but I
honestly couldn't manage a full sentence. Finally I recovered slightly.
&quot;I'm a little surprised by the scope of all this. What's the
purpose?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Our president, Noda-sama, should be arriving in a few
days. I'm sure he will be happy to address your questions in detail.&quot;
Tanaka paused for the green tea, delivered by a silent girl—the young, smiling,
uniformed Japanese &quot;office lady&quot;— who scarcely looked up as she
settled the tray on the desk. After she was gone, he continued. &quot;This, of
course, is only the financial nerve center for our operation. Our technical
staff will begin arriving soon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Technical staff? Then who were those grim-faced minions out
there punching computers?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're bringing in more people?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Correct. Which is why I needed to see you. I understand
that the lease on the floor above us is due for renewal at the end of this
month. We would like to acquire that space. We will need to convert it as
quickly as possible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What about the current tenants?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There is a rider in their lease, Mr. Walton, that
permits the owner of the building to reclaim the space for his own use at the
time of a renewal. We fully intend to make use of it. Consequently as our
American attorney you are hereby authorized to inform them that their lease
will not be automatically extended, that they will be expected to vacate. In
accordance with the legal and binding terms of their lease. Advise them also
that there can be no grace period. We will require the floor immediately.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I looked at him. So much for the current tenants. &quot;What
will these new offices be used for?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tanaka sipped his tea. &quot;That section will have another
managing director. Our range of operations here brings other
responsibilities.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What section, what range of operations?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I am regrettably not at liberty to discuss the specific
extent of DNI's interests.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, let me break some news to you. I like to know who
I'm working for. So you'd better start discussing specifics and fast.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tanaka seemed to be having trouble meeting my eye. The skull
beneath his short-cropped hair glistened under the harsh neon lighting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton, you are now part of the DNI team. That
position includes obligations I am sure you would not wish to take
lightly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hold on.&quot; The hell with politeness. &quot;I'm not
part of your 'team' or anybody's. I came on board with the explicit
understanding that—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton, kindly sit down.&quot; He pointed without
ceremony to a chair. I just looked at it, then back at him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you are a scholar of </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>,&quot; he continued, &quot;I'm sure you are aware that an
employee's loyalty to his company is considered to be a gauge of his character.
A company is a family, and one considers its interests in that spirit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe you didn't notice, but I'm not Japanese. '<i>Nihon-jin'</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>as you'd
probably put it. I'm a <i>gaijin</i>. We usually work for number one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;At the moment, Mr. Walton, you work for Dai Nippon.
There is an assigned role for you, one that Noda-san expects you to fulfill.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe I just handed in my resignation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I do not really think you would wish to do that.&quot;
Deadpan. The confidence with which he made that statement told me this guy
could make a killing at poker. Unless he had a few cards in the hole I didn't
know about. &quot;It would hardly be in your best interest. We expect your
contribution to be crucial.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What contribution?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That will become plain in due time, Mr. Walton.&quot;
He was measuring his words as he continued, maybe easing up a bit. &quot;For
now, let me merely say we know you to be a man with substantial curiosity.
Consequently we believe that what lies ahead will be of considerable interest
to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What was this samurai up to?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe it's time everybody put their cards on the table.
And why don't we begin with you.&quot; I thumbed at the floor outside.
&quot;What the hell's going on out there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;At the moment nothing in this office need concern you.
But perhaps I can tell you this. Now that you are serving as our corporate
attorney, you are in a position to help us pursue other avenues.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I looked him over. Tanaka was beating about the bush. Why?
Maybe it was merely the Japanese style, but he also seemed to know exactly what
not to say.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm still waiting to hear what's next.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very well. As long as you're here . . .&quot; He sipped
calmly from his cup. &quot;It is common knowledge that Japanese savers have
become the world's largest lenders, with overseas investment that now exceeds,
by the way, the greatest rate of lending by OPEC even at its peak. The Japanese
people will have over a trillion dollars in overseas assets within the next few
years.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm familiar with the numbers.&quot; I also knew that
with several trillion dollars in spare change sloshing around back home, they
were sending abroad a mere dribble of what they had.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Were you also aware that over four fifths of our
overseas investment is currently in dollar-denominated instruments?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No surprise. The dollar's still the name of the game,
worldwide.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;True enough, but we at Dai Nippon are concerned that so
many of our institutions have such heavy exposure in a single currency.
Accordingly, in addition to our program with interest- rate futures, we also
feel it would be prudent to provide some protection for this currency risk. In
the same manner, I might add, that American investors often do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean some downside protection? On the dollar?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is correct. A devaluation or a sudden drop in
exchange rates would jeopardize much Japanese capital. Therefore we feel it
would be prudent to enter the currency-futures markets to cover at least some
of the dollar exposure of our investors.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jesus! I suddenly needed a Valium. In addition to Treasuries,
now Dai Nippon was about to short the dollar, pre-sell it in advance of . . .
of what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Had Noda been lying to me right down the line? Setting up a
cockamamie cover with interest futures while all along he was setting up an
international currency swindle?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or were we about to get down to the real action? He'd
scheduled his curtain raiser, whatever it was, then realized he might
accidentally pull the plug on the U.S. greenback? So he'd decided to arrange a
little currency insurance for everybody back at the ranch, just in case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Don't ask me why, but I was drawn to this pending nightmare
like a moth to flame. This was a ringside seat at . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All right, who am I trying to kid? That was the moment when I
finally, finally grasped what our meeting was all about. It was to formally
announce the tidal wave that would soon engulf </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. And now Matsuo Noda—or maybe I should say Noah—was, in his
oblique Japanese way, handing me a pair of tickets good for one round-trip
passage on his ark. The only thing missing was the schedule.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By then I didn't care whether I was on board or not; I
figured I'd just as soon try swimming on my own. But I had one very good reason
to play along.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, what's the game? Want to sell some dollars for
delivery down the road?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We assume you are familiar with the markets.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I stay in touch. How would you like to go? If you want</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>currency
futures, there're the exchanges. Or you can buy forwards, which are more or
less the same thing, from any number of banks around town. Futures only go out
for a year, maximum, but I can probably get you forwards out to three. Come to
think of it, Citibank will quote you ten-year forwards.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We would be looking at shorter terms.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No problem. Currency futures are quoted for March,
June, September, and December. That's on the </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Chicago</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> Mercantile Exchange's IMM. But if three months are too far
out, then you can get options on spot currency contracts down at the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Philadelphia</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> exchange, which allows early
exercise. Or if you want, I think you can get off-exchange bank quotes as short
as one month. Citibank has a big FOREX desk. And Bankers Trust, and First
Boston, or even Banque Indosuez. Of course, if you really want to get serious,
there's the currency trading floor at Barclays Bank in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>London</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We expect to be active in all markets, worldwide. That
seems best.&quot; Tanaka continued, &quot;However, we are only interested in
December futures and one-month contracts in the forwards. After that, we may
choose to . . . make other arrangements.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hang on, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right. And what are we talking here in terms of
amount?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He handed me a sheet of paper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was like he was ordering up sandwiches from the deli. Corned
beef on rye, lean, with extra mustard and a slice of pickle. How many? Let me
check. Oh, say a few hundred billion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is going to take a few days.&quot; I passed it
back, calmly as I could manage. &quot;Why don't you send a schedule down to my
place late this afternoon. My secretary will be there. I'll get started in the
morning.&quot; I rose. &quot;In the meantime, you'll understand if I take today
off and catch up a little on other work.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course.&quot; Tanaka bowed, head still glistening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Be in touch tomorrow.&quot; I nodded farewell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Until then, Mr. Walton.&quot; Another bow as I turned
to leave.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I walked back through the floor, again trying to digest the
spectacle. This was undoubtedly the most comprehensive operation I'd ever
witnessed. What in hell did all this analysis of industrial sectors have to do
with currency hedging?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Not a lot of time to reflect on the question, however, since
I was summarily being ushered toward the steel security doors by one of
Tanaka's flunkies, a young tough who seemed to speak no English, but who could
strong-arm very eloquently.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In moments I was outside, facing the bank of elevators. That
was when I remembered the upstairs tenant, a big public relations outfit.
Better take a couple of minutes and give them the word.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Rausch, McKinley, and Stein were in the middle of proving
conclusively that our mayor knew nothing about contract kickbacks, that he was
in fact the closest equivalent </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New
  York</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> had to driven
snow. His Honor, in the meantime, was hastily returning the campaign
contributions of all the real estate executives who, flanked by their lawyers,
were now being featured on the front page of the Daily News.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since RM&amp;S had their hands full and also had expected an
automatic renewal of their lease, there weren't too many politic smiles when I
broke the news. Fact is, it was a very unpleasant scene. Finally I called for
their lease and showed them the rider. They'd signed the damn thing, not me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sorry, fellows, all I can do is maybe drag this out a
little for you, mislay the paperwork or something. Have one of your attorneys
give me a call, off the record. But I'd also advise you to start looking for
space.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I headed downtown, a man with a mission.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dai Nippon had to be getting ready to kick hell out of
something or somebody. Trouble was, I had no idea who or what. But I'd had
plenty of hints it wasn't going to do great things for the dollar. I briefly
toyed with alerting Jack O'Donnell and telling him to leak some anonymous storm
signals. But what storm? He wouldn't put his senate reputation on the line to
peddle guesswork, and all I had to offer was— what?—circumstantial
premonitions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where to begin? </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
was in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>London</span><span

no chance of getting him and his less reputable </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Washington</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> connections to start shouting &quot;fire&quot; from the
rooftops. That left the press. Right. What I needed was the media. Think.
Somebody who, if the whole thing proved to be smoke and mirrors, could shrug it
off; but, a comer who would be intrigued by the possible broadcasting coup of
the century. It had to be somebody with ready-made exposure, yet a personality
with little to lose and a lot to gain. That brought to mind the perfect
candidate, a former, well, acquaintance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I got home, I went straight to the office upstairs,
looked up a number I hadn't used in a long time, and dialed it. It felt very
familiar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Channel Eight. 'The freshest news in </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thank you.&quot; On came the Muzak.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Would she do it? She used to complain how fed up she was
interviewing witnesses to car crashes. Her career needed a transfusion of hard
news so the station management would start taking her seriously. Well, here was
her shot. And since she was roughly tenth in line for the &quot;anchor&quot;
spot, she had no reputation of noticeable proportions to jeopardize by leaking
an anonymous rumor the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> was about to be shelled by an
offshore battery of financial guns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why is it some women can't just let bygones be bygones? Give
me a break, Donna. I was ready for anything, except her little bedroom games.
&quot;How about advising Ms. Austen I'm sorry I called at such an important

from total ruin.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Another very long pause. Finally I heard Donna's
broadcast-neutral diphthongs, those lower-register reverberations she'd worked

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

color:windowtext'>Good question. The answer, sadly, was that nobody inside the
system would want to even hear this kind of talk, let alone spread it.
Everybody in the financial community was already whistling in the dark,
terrified those Latin American debt dominos might start to tumble, taking a few
of our flagship banks along with them. And now this? No way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

mortify me once. And believe me that's the last—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Will you <i>listen</i>, for chrissake. I know it sounds
crazy, but this is dead serious. I've taken on a foreign investment firm as a
client. I can't tell you the name, but I'm absolutely sure the guy running it
is about to screw this country somehow. He's been shorting the bond market, and
now he's going to start dumping dollars. Billions and billions. I want to blow
the whistle. Get something on the air that'll cause a few bankers and traders
to look up from their computer terminals and—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

favor?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Simple. Don't ever call me here again. And while you're
at it, tell that asshole friend of yours, Bill Henderson, I think he's the
biggest—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

at you</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

tone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe she was right. Maybe I was seeing things. In any case,
that aborted Monday's attempted guerrilla war against Matsuo Noda. Now to man
my barricades.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which moment coincided with the sound of Emma Epstein's key
in the front-door lock. The time, obviously, was exactly one-thirty P.M.
Exactly. I waited till she'd settled in before taking the fatal step.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Emma, how about bringing me that file in your left-hand
desk drawer. The one marked 'Trust Account.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The blue one?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right. Amy's. You know it. You updated the thing about
a month ago when I switched all her money out of stocks and into money-market
funds.&quot; That move had been my one small attempt to ride Noda's horse in
the direction I suspected it was headed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I remember.&quot; She glanced at me disdainfully.
&quot;I also remember you predicted interest rates were about to go up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which, she was tactful enough not to add, they hadn't. She
also didn't mention she had greeted my market prognosis with open skepticism.
As usual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, for what it's worth, I still think rates are
headed up soon. And Emma . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot; She was grimly digging through the files.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ever think about some gold stocks for your retirement
investments? There're some mining issues I hear look good. Golden Sceptre,
Golaith, Vanderbilt . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's Amy's portfolio you wanted, correct?&quot; She
didn't miss a beat. &quot;Right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She doted on Amy and always got very testy whenever I dabbled
in the management of my daughter's little nest egg. It's galling to admit
Emma's market instincts did at times seem superior to mine. John Maynard Keynes
once said there's nothing so disastrous as a rational investment policy in an
irrational world. Maybe he was right: could be I was shackled by too much
logical introspection. Never a problem for Emma. All I know is, if her
daughter-in-law in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Jersey</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> phoned in (on my line) that she'd
just baked a terrific cherry pie using &quot;New Improved!&quot; Crisco, Emma
marched out and loaded up on Procter &amp; Gamble. And the damn thing
automatically went up ten points.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Here it is.&quot; She placed it on my desk with a
decidedly disapproving sniff.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dear Lord, I thought, stand by us sinners now and at the hour
of our death. I went over it quickly with a hand calculator. About ninety-four
thousand. Which I figured would pay for roughly a year and a half of college
the way those already inflated costs were skyrocketing. But by the time Noda
got finished with the dollar, it probably wouldn't cover a weekend seminar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe I couldn't save the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
but I was damned well going to get my daughter through school. With fear and
trembling I started calling banks. Naturally I spread the action around town,
BS'ing a lot of currency traders and bank FOREX (foreign exchange) departments
in the process. I'd buy some pounds sterling, then . . . by the way, long as
we're on the phone, Mort, I think I might need a few million yen in, oh, say about
a month. Why don't we just save time and write some contracts now? Besides,
bird in the hand, you know. Then I'd take those pounds I'd just acquired and
use them to buy several million deutsche-mark forwards from the next dealer I
knew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How much did I go out, total? Remember, currency forwards run
around a penny on the dollar, so I effectively &quot;sold&quot; something like
ten million greenbacks, deliverable in one month, when I figured they'd be
worth . . . it was hard even to imagine. Most likely zilch. Since I was flying
blind. Amy's college fund bought everything. You name it, I went long. She
ended up owning futures on Swiss francs, German marks, yen, lira, pounds
sterling, Canadian dollars, even French francs. I was actually tempted,
briefly, by the peso (well, she loved her trip to </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Mexico</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> last summer), a sentimental gesture
I sternly resisted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By the time I'd finished it was </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>four forty-five</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

basket of foreign currencies had just arrived home from her </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>West Side</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> private school. She always charged
in at four-thirty. I called Joanna and asked to speak to my daughter. Jo's
response to the sound of my voice was only slightly less fulsome than Donna
Austen's. Finally Amy appeared at my ear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dad, how come you're calling on the downstairs phone?
You're supposed to always use the one in my room. Mom hates it when—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

engagement between the hours of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>four thirty-one</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> and eight- fifteen. It's never possible to reach you there

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing much. How about if you and I caught up on
things a bit? What do you say to dinner tonight? Just the two of us? We might
even consider a real grown-up meal for a change, no alfalfa sprouts.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where?&quot; She was immediately on guard. What if she
ended up confronted with a red-tinged steak, sliced off one of the living
mammals of the earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

currently being hedged via a comparatively unorthodox investment scenario.

style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> a hundred stories down to give me
much time to talk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What I really wanted to tell her but somehow didn't was that
I'd had this spiritualist vision we'd been reincarnated as a couple of those
crazy sheiks at Monte Carlo—when I'm the guy who never ventures past the
quarter slots next to the door. It was as though I'd pillaged the hundred grand
carefully hoarded for her future and spread it over a giant roulette play,
stacking chips on every number on the board. Who knew where Dai Nippon's wheel
would stop, but when it did, one of them had to pay off a hundred to one. Noda
couldn't touch us. Right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam was headed east in the black Nissan limo, listening to
the talk. And thinking. Seated alongside was Kenji Asano, wearing a light tan
suit and gold cufflinks, while the space opposite was occupied by two
individuals who made her very uneasy. One was the instantly famous Matsuo Noda,
the other his niece, talk-show economist Akira Mori. Noda was wearing a black
three-piece banker's suit, the perfect accompaniment to his silver hair, and
small wireless spectacles that magnified his penetrating eyes. Mori, in
designer beige, looked as if she'd just stepped from the NHK studios, which in
fact she had only a few hours earlier.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Three days had passed since Noda's Imperial press conference,
four counting today, with this sudden trip being only the latest in a series of
unexpected events. The major new twist: getting her interviews rolling was
turning out to be a lot harder than it should have been. Before leaving </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, she'd arranged for a day with Dr.
Noburu Matsugami of the Electrotechnical Institute at </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tsukuba</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Science</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
 </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>City</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> to go over the latest progress of
MITI's Advanced Robot Technology Project, now the world leader, the undisputed
state of the art in robotics. Matsugami had even volunteered to supply
introductions to the other MITI labs at Tsukuba. Everything was set.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Except now it wasn't. When she called Friday to confirm their
meeting, Dr. Matsugami advised her that some unexpected schedule conflicts had
come up. Most apologetic. Perhaps they could try again week after next.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What's more, that was her last call for the day, because
immediately afterward her hotel phone had gone dead for five hours. Management
was strangely evasive about the problem. When a temporary line was finally
installed, it had a curious whine that made conversation all but impossible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My luck, she thought. Japanese technology, the best in the
world, breaks down on me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Consequently it was almost a relief to get out of town. Not
the least of reasons being </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> still had a hangover from all the
sword celebrations. Its streets were strewn with debris, and services remained
haphazard. As planned, she and Ken departed the next afternoon on the
Shinkansen bullet train— first class, where the porters wear white gloves and
bow after making an announcement to the car. The only way to travel. Finally
some peace and quiet after the madness of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
she'd told herself. It felt like the Concorde, except with legroom. She leaned
back to watch as the white peak of Mt. Fuji flashed by at a hundred and forty
miles per hour and chatted with Ken, who was sitting next to her, glancing
through some MITI memos he'd brought along.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The trip down, zipping through industrial </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Nagoya</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, had helped to settle her mind. </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. For her there was nowhere else quite like it in the
world. If you knew the byways, it could be a universe away from the mania of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Time to lighten up. At least she had no reason to
suspect Ken was giving her the runaround. He'd seemed genuinely disturbed when
she told him about Matsugami's polite refusal to talk. Didn't say much: just
frowned, was strangely silent for a moment, then declared he'd make a few phone
calls and check into it when there was time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kenji Asano, she noticed, seemed to have a split personality:
one for her and one for the rest of the world. In public he was all Japanese,
striding ahead and ostentatiously barking opinions. But that, she knew, was
merely for appearances; he'd have been the object of silent derision by elders
if he'd displayed the slightest consideration for his female companion. (She
recalled that famous Japanese proverb: The man who falls in love with his wife
merely spoils his mother's servant.) Okay, she told herself as she trailed
along, when in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Rome</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> . . . Japanese men need to strut and
bully their women in public; it's the only chance they get. Everybody knows the
obedient little helpmate dutifully pacing behind garnishees his paycheck and
doles back whatever she likes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ken's stern, traditional public face, however, was merely one
of his many personas. Alone with her he could be as Western as any Japanese man
would permit himself. For a Japanese, of course, &quot;Western&quot; doesn't
mean all the glad-handing bonhomie of an American; there's always an element of
reserve. Just the same, he was nothing like the typical sexless, oblique
Japanese businessman. He had a superb body, taut and athletic, which he knew
better than to bury in some cheap off-the-rack Japanese suit. No polyester;
strictly silk and finest wool. He had a sense of style: the power look. And he
really was a widower, whose wife had died in a freak auto crash soon after
their marriage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In short, Kenji Asano was complex, not easy to categorize.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The same went for Matsuo Noda. As she and Ken were coming
down on the train, a porter had come through the car announcing &quot;<i>denwa</i>,&quot;
a call for Dr. Asano. When he returned, he reported that Matsuo Noda needed to
make a quick trip down to the famous Shinto shrine at Ise tomorrow morning, to
review the site for the new museum Dai Nippon, International would build to
house the sword, and wanted him to come along, a good time to discuss their
mutual interests.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He always seems to know everything that goes on.&quot;
Ken smiled wistfully. &quot;He also 'suggested' that perhaps my visiting
American colleague would like to make the trip too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Oh, Tam thought, why me? That's not the way Japanese
executives go about things. Women aren't part of their high-level conferences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't understand this, Ken.&quot; She'd been half
dozing, but now she was coming awake very rapidly. &quot;Seems a little
strange, don't you think?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Asano shrugged. &quot;He just said he'd like to meet
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why? What did you tell him about me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing, really . . .&quot; He glanced away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Curious.&quot; She was fully alert now. &quot;Then how
did he . . . ?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, don't be naive. Matsuo Noda knows who you are,
believe me.&quot; He shot her an admiring glance. &quot;Why are you frowning?
It's true. He knows all about your work. He practically demanded you come
along. He called you—what was it?—'that brilliant American professor.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, something about this doesn't add up.&quot;
She was having her first experience of Matsuo Noda's long arm, and she found it
unsettling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why not? Tamara, you of all people should know we
Japanese have a national tradition of honoring guests. Noda-san is old school,
through and through.&quot; He leaned back. &quot;Besides, he's bringing
somebody else along to meet you. Could be very interesting.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He told her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So here they were in the Dai Nippon limo, a stretch, with
acres of room and green tea that flowed till she thought she would burst. What
was that old line about the roomful of <i>zaibatsu </i>negotiators: the one
with the toughest bladder prevails.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Seeing Matsuo Noda in person confirmed everything she'd
sensed about him on the TV. He was a genius. Still, something about him told
you that when you sat down to cards with this man, you'd do well to cut the
deck. What really took her aback, though, was the woman alongside him, Akira
Mori.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Could be it was just her style. Tam was definitely
overwhelmed. For the trip she'd worn her softly tailored Calvin Klein suit (her
only one), in shades of pale, warm gray, and set it off with some simple, stark
silver picked up on a trip to Morocco. Perfect pitch. She looked smashing,
feminine yet all business, and Ken had told her so at least three times. All
the same she wasn't prepared for Mori's ostentatious fashion statement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When the DNI limo appeared at their hotel, the International,
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s favorite TV money guru was wearing
one of her severe Rei Kawakubo ensembles, a small ransom in gold accessories,
and enough makeup for a haute couture ramp model. It turned out she'd taped an
early morning interview show at NHK's </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
studios for broadcast that night, then come down directly on the Shinkansen.
She greeted Tam and Ken with scarcely more than a frosty nod. Tam found this
standoffish manner puzzling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the other hand it did fit perfectly with Ken's quick
morning briefing on Noda's famous niece. Quite a story. According to him, her
father, Dr. Toshi Noda, had been a celebrated figure in years past. An honors
graduate of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>University</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
he'd been the star mathematics professor of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
 </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>University</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> when he was summarily conscripted by
Prime Minister Tojo to take charge of wartime cryptography, codes. Tojo wanted the
best, and he got it. Consequently mild-mannered Toshi Noda had been one of the
minds behind the famous Purple Machine, used for Japanese ciphers during the
early part of the war.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Eventually, however, the project became redundant. After a
time Tojo ceased to trust the Purple Machine and decided to replace it with
that famous Nazi invention, the Enigma Machine. (On that one, Ken had added
with a touch of irony, Toshi Noda was well vindicated. The Enigma Machine code
had already been cracked by the Allies long before Hitler—declaring it
unbreakable—delivered it to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Toshi Noda resembled his older brother Matsuo physically, but
he differed radically in outlook, being a devout Buddhist and a pacifist. After
the stunning Japanese bloodbath at </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>Saipan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
which demonstrated the war was clearly lost, he'd been one of those imprudent
citizens who'd spoken out publicly for peace. Not surprisingly, he was
immediately placed under surveillance by the Kempei Tai, </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s secret police, and shortly thereafter jailed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After three months' internment he was released a broken man.
A week later he committed ritual <i>seppuku</i>, disemboweling himself for the
crime of having disgraced the family.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Toshi Noda's diaries, published posthumously and read widely
in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, revealed his deep repugnance for
the wartime</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>government.
He believed that Prime Minister Tojo had become, in effect, a neo-shogun.
Although the shogunate supposedly had been abolished when Emperor Meiji took
control and opened </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> in 1867, Toshi Noda saw it restored with
Tojo, another &quot;shogun&quot; who had come along and isolated the country
once again. Nonetheless, he'd been a man of few words. His death poem, written
only moments before he put the knife to his stomach, was as simple and intense
as his life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Darkness

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That last was a traditional phrase that, simply translated,
meant &quot;son of heaven.&quot; For a Japanese, though, the overtones are
more; they say &quot;the way of the emperor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Subsequent history proved him prescient on several points—the
main one being that militarism was a disaster for </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Also, he had rightly feared that the monarchy would
become an empty symbol in the ruins of Tojo's hopeless war. Although he hadn't
lived to see Tojo tried and hanged as a criminal, he had predicted the outcome
of the war unerringly—and he'd insisted that his infant daughter be evacuated
to Sasayama just before the Allies moved in for the kill. Because of his
foresight she escaped the first firebombing of </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>, which converted the city into a giant death oven for eighty
thousand innocent Japanese civilians too old or young to escape. </span><span

solution&quot;: </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Auschwitz</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> with airborne incendiaries. The rest
of Toshi Noda's family was burned alive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Afterward Matsuo Noda had complied with another of Toshi
Noda's wishes and made certain his daughter received a first-class education.
Since she had a natural instinct for economics he'd encouraged her, rightly
foreseeing it as a discipline vital to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
in the twenty-first century. She had excelled beyond his fondest expectations;
she was in fact brilliant. As a result he grew to dote on her, to an extent
that eventually grew almost obsessive. He'd even made her his heir, since he
had none of his own. His fortune was rumored to be in the tens of millions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Probably the most important thing to keep in mind about</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Akira Mori,
Ken had concluded, was that she merely looked <i>avant-garde</i>. Inside she
lived in another age. In fact he suspected the reason she'd never married had
something to do with the fact she was already wed: to the vision of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s powerful, sacred Imperial past.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the trip down to Ise, Mori had silently sipped her green
tea while Noda chatted with Asano about the costs and timing of commercializing
the intelligent machines that would come out of the Fifth Generation Project.
Although Noda stuck to generalities, it was clear he was totally conversant
with the latest developments in the field. In fact, Tam found herself thinking,
he seemed to know anything there was to know about just about everything. He
displayed the same obsession with </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s
technological future that the old-time shoguns must have had about the
goings-on of their vassals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She also sensed that he and Asano were doing a lot of their
communicating in a verbal shorthand, enough so that she began to suspect they
had worked together before: they were like father and son, each anticipating
the other's thoughts and conclusions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By the time they reached Ise it was already late afternoon,
but Noda's driver had phoned ahead from the car and arranged rooms for the
night at the local spa, so they wouldn't have to go back late. She noticed
there hadn't been any talk about the famous Sword, but she figured maybe he was
saving that for dinner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The museum Noda planned was to be built outside the shrine
proper, just before you crossed the wide, arched </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Uji</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
 </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bridge</span><span

style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> that separated Shinto's holy ground
from the ordinary world. The shrine itself, a collection of thatched-roof
buildings in severe traditional style, was hidden down a long trail among giant
cryptomeria trees that towered hundreds of feet into the pale afternoon sky.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Attesting to the speed with which things can happen in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> when there's the go-ahead from above, the location
had already been staked and the trees cleared. Excavation for the foundation
merely awaited Noda's approval. While everybody else stood around and waited,
he consulted with the site engineer, checked over the plans, and made a few
final changes. All the while, onlookers were bowing to him right and left. He'd
become, overnight, an authentic Japanese legend.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After finishing with the engineer, he suggested they stroll
on down to pay respects at the shrine itself, since they'd come all this way.
Their burly chauffeur suddenly became a bodyguard, clearing the path ahead.
Noda was expansive now, presumably confident his niche in history was secure.
As they were crossing the wooden bridge, he casually asked Tam what she knew
about the Sword.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A one-of-a-kind historical find, she replied. Important and
fascinating. She'd seen the Emperor on TV. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I assumed you would understand its significance.&quot;
He was leading the way down the path. &quot;Perhaps then you'll indulge me a
moment for an ancient tale about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By now the entire shrine had been cleared of tourists and
they were surrounded only by bowing and smiling priests in white robes: the VIP
treatment. &quot;The Imperial sword harkens back in a way to our version of
Adam and Eve. Except, according to our own creation story, they were also the
ones who created </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>; they were the original <i>kami</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;The original Japanese gods.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, perhaps 'god' is too strong a term, Dr.
Richardson. I prefer to think of our <i>kami</i> as merely spirits of
life.&quot; Noda shrugged, then continued. &quot;According to the myth, the
first male and female <i>kami</i> stirred the sea with a long spear, then
lifted it, and the brine that dropped from its tip piled up and became </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She caught herself smiling. &quot;I've always wondered what
Freud would have thought of that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mori glared at her in a way that suggested some offense at
her irreverence, while MIT-educated Ken merely stifled a grin. Noda, however,
took the quip in stride.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Freud? Ah, yes, your philosopher. I seem to recall he's
the one who regarded almost everything as some manifestation of our sexual
appetite. Well, these are primitive stories, Dr. Richardson, that describe the
beginning of life. I suppose they should be somewhat earthy, wouldn't you
agree?&quot; He chuckled. &quot;Nonetheless, according to our early tales, the
Sun Goddess—whose shrine this is—was created out of the left eye, the side of
honor, of the first male <i>kami</i>, and the Moon God was created out of his
right. Then they ascended into the skies.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She glanced up. The Sun Goddess appeared to be headed for
bed, the sky itself barely light through the cryptomeria. The air was beginning
to grow slightly crisp.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now we come to the sword. When the Sun Goddess finally
sent her grandson down to rule over the mortals below, he brought with him the
three items that became the emblems of Imperial rule. They were the sacred
mirror, signifying purity, a curved bead necklace, used to ward off evil
spirits, and the sword, standing for courage. The great grandson of that first
earthbound immortal extended his dominion over all of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and became the first emperor. We are told his name
was Jimmu, and the legends say that was around 660 B.C.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>So desu</i>,&quot; Miss Mori interjected abruptly,
startling even Ken. She seemed to be lecturing directly to Tam. &quot;We all
know our Emperor today is directly descended from him. In fact, he is precisely
the one hundred and twenty-fourth emperor after Jimmu. </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and the Imperial line were born simultaneously, and
every Japanese is related to him. We are a monoracial state.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam glanced at her. By God, she wasn't kidding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, it's possible the traditional account has
reworked historical facts a trifle,&quot; Noda continued smoothly.
&quot;Actually the peoples who became our modern Japanese seem to have made
their way here to the main island from somewhere in the South Pacific and
settled in this area around Ise. Near here we still find burial mounds that
contain replicas of their early symbols of Imperial authority—mirrors, gems,
swords.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But the sword you found? Did it really come down from
on high?&quot; Tam asked, half hoping to rankle Akira Mori.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean was it that very first one?&quot; Noda
shrugged. &quot;Who could locate the original Garden of Eden? Please, we all
must allow for a certain element of poetic license in our myths. But it is
unquestionably the sword referred to in the ancient chronicles such as the
Heite Monogatari, which dates from the Heian era, the ninth through twelfth
centuries. That sword was lost in 1185, and now it's been recovered. That's all
we know for sure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mori, walking along in her quick, Japanese-woman pace,
obviously was not satisfied with Noda's rationalist version of history.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Richardson,&quot; she cut in again, &quot;what the
recovery of the sword has achieved is to remind the Japanese people that we are
unique. We Japanese have a special soul, a Yamato <i>minzoku </i>of pure blood
and spiritual unity. All Japanese are related to each other and to the Emperor,
so there is a oneness of spirit, a blood-and-soul relation, between the Emperor
and his people. Yamatoists believe, rightly, that a temporary eclipse of our
Japanese <i>minzoku</i> was brought about by the American occupation, whose
imposed constitution and educational system were acts of racial revenge against
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Our postwar identity crisis, our
negative image of ourselves, was created by Americans. But that time is over.
Although we have no single God, as in the Judeo-Christian tradition, we have
something even more powerful. Through our Emperor we have a line of descent
that harkens back to the beginning of our world. Perhaps we no longer choose to
claim he is divine, but that makes him no less an embodiment of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s special place.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Akira Mori, Tam suddenly realized, was a closet Yamatoist,
those new right-wing racist firebrands of modern </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. Time to give her a little heat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Surely nobody today seriously thinks the Emperor's
forefather came down from the skies?&quot; She turned back to Noda. &quot;You
don't believe it, do you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He shrugged. &quot;Ours is a skeptical world, Dr. Richardson.
Is your pope really infallible, or did he acquire his right to be divine
spokesman by winning a small election? Nonetheless, popes and kings are like
ancient tribal leaders. Despite all our modern democracy, we still yearn for a
figure to embody our identity. For the Japanese to have an emperor who, if only
in legend, has blood kinship with the gods who created our homeland—what could
be more important?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>About that time Tam glanced up and realized they were passing
under a large <i>torii </i>gate, entryway to a place that seemingly had nothing
to do with the real world. Just beyond were the shrines, reminding her somewhat
of a sanitized tropical village as imagined by </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Hollywood</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. Each of the cypress-wood buildings, set above the ground on
stilts, was architecture at its most primal, a study in simplicity. Their
polished wood was untouched by a speck of paint, while the foot-thick blanket
of woven straw comprising their roofs had a creamy texture that looked like
cheesecake. There was nothing in the world to compare.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What really made them unique, though, was something else
entirely. Although the shrines were merely straw and natural wood, possessing
none of the centuries-old authority of the cathedrals of </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Europe</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, in a curious way they were actually</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>older, for
they had been rebuilt anew every twenty years since time immemorial.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Suddenly the real significance of that struck her. What other
people had kept alive such a powerful symbol of their common heritage for
centuries and centuries? Westerners had difficulty grasping the continuity this
shrine represented. Little wonder Noda could galvanize his clan with some
powerful new reminder of who they were. Shinto wasn't a religion; there were
few rules and no payoff in the sky. Instead it was the mortar binding a race.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The main shrines over there,&quot; he continued,
pointing to a collection of buildings in an area enclosed by a high wooden
fence, &quot;are off limits to all save the Emperor himself and certain of the
priests. That ground is the sacred link between our Emperor living now and
those of times past. Even photographs are forbidden.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam noticed that many of the gables of the buildings were
tipped in gold, burning amber when an occasional shaft of late sunlight
reflected off them. Dusk was starting to settle in, and the evening birds and
crickets had begun to add their eerie sound effects. She found herself deeply
touched. What was it about the place that inspired such reverence? Was it the
serenity? The purity?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, this Shinto holy of holies possessed a secret power, the
unassailable strength of nature. It moved her; how could it not? Somewhere
inside she felt envy of them all, felt a yearning to share their absolute sense
of' who they were.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While she reflected on that, surrounded by the white gravel
and golden woods, she found herself looking anew at Ken. Being here with him at
Ise made her question once again whether in his world, his austere yet deeply
passionate world, she could never be anything but a <i>gaijin</i>, an outsider.</span></p>

<h1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>CHAPTER TEN</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:1.0pt;color:windowtext'><img
width=33 height=33 src="images/image008.jpg" alt=""></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was almost dark when they reached the spa, one of those
vast Japanese resort hotels catering to the middle class. It had a
fake-traditional exterior and hundreds of rooms inside, as though the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Temple</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> of the Golden Pavilion had somehow
been hollowed out and enlarged to encompass a health club. Strangely, though,
it had been completely cleared, guests sent on their way; it was totally,
absolutely empty. The parking lot was cordoned off, and gardeners were busily
clipping and manicuring the grounds. Tam was impressed. Dai Nippon must have
plenty of clout, she told herself, to be able to commandeer an entire hotel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The manager came out to meet Noda, deferentially bowing and
sucking in his breath, after which their few bags were summarily swept away.
When Noda returned he said nothing, merely smiled and suggested they all retire
to the big public baths on the lower level. Since the hotel was a vacation
retreat, the basement was almost entirely devoted to the one universal love of
the Japanese public—scalding water.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Down they went through the concrete hallways, attendants and
staff bobbing. The sauna-like baths, like the hotel, seemed to be theirs alone.
While Noda and Ken retired to the men's section down the corridor, Tam and Mori
entered the women's side, a cavernous tile-floored room with a steaming pool at
one end. Local women in white head-kerchiefs immediately appeared and began to
fuss over their guests, scrubbing and rinsing them while praising the famous
Noda-sama. Then, as Mori's towel dropped away, Tam looked her over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good figure. She had always believed that, judged by Western
standards, Japanese women tended to be somewhat flat-chested and to have
shortish calves, characteristics the high-waisted kimono was well designed to
disguise—which also explained why a Western woman wearing one could easily look
like a buxom stork. Mori, however, had a lithe, well-proportioned shape, and
her breasts were positively generous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The intimacy of the bath didn't noticeably humanize her
however. While they soaked and steamed, she volunteered nothing beyond a few routine
pleasantries. No more tirades about Yamatoism and American treachery, but no
informal talk either. After a polite interval Tam excused herself to go
upstairs to her room and freshen up for dinner. Mori's agenda clearly differed
from Noda's; this woman, she concluded, had a game plan all her own. But what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Not long afterward she heard Ken tapping lightly on the door.
Just as she'd hoped. After the hot, steamy bath, he couldn't have been more
welcome. In fact she took one look at him, pristine and elegant in his blue
silk <i>yukata</i>, and briefly considered undressing him right there in the
doorway—with her teeth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was a wonderful lover, by turns gentle and forceful, as
though their being together was some exquisite ceremony. Their lovemaking
always had a particularly Japanese quality, a heightened appreciation of the
erotic, derived no doubt from a tradition that values subtlety and sensual
satisfaction. Afterward they shared a brief soak in the little redwood tub
there in her room, then he headed down the hall to change.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, she told herself, coming down to Ise has been well
worth the trip. Matsuo Noda is definitely eccentric, but all the same he's a
Renaissance man by any gauge. Still, why did he want to meet me? Just to tell
me ancient fables? No, that's some kind of prelude. The real theme is yet to be
announced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she started putting her hair up in some quick curlers to
try and recover from the steam, she pushed aside her misgivings. Although she
only had the suit she'd worn down, intended for business, she decided it didn't
matter. Surely tonight would be informal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was just finishing up with her hair when she heard a
frantic pounding on the door. Very un-Japanese. Puzzling, she cracked it open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ken was standing there, no slippers, still in his <i>yukata</i>,
which he hadn't bothered to tie, all the color gone from his face. Behind him
were two uniformed hotel maids, bearing what was surely the most gorgeous
kimono she had ever seen, heavy silk with a hand-painted landscape, edged in
gold brocade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tamara, I had no idea, honestly. Noda-sama only found
out when we got here, and he couldn't say anything. It was all top secret,
heavy security. They only just arrived a few minutes ago, and he's asked Noda
to dine with him.&quot; He paused for breath. &quot;We're invited too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who's just arrived?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Asano was so nonplussed he didn't hear her. &quot;Apparently
he wanted to review the site plans personally, tomorrow, to see where the
museum will be. I hear the Imperial Household was set against it, but he
insisted.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who, for God's sake?&quot; The impossible answer was
rapidly dawning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Abruptly he paused, embarrassed by his own mental disarray.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His Majesty. Tam, we're about to meet the Emperor of
Japan.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In marched the bowing maids, lots of long-vowel
honorifics—they apparently assumed the honorable Richardson-san must be </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s First Lady—and took over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam knew full well that donning a formal kimono was no small
undertaking, but she'd forgotten what a major task it really could be. First
came the undergarments: cotton vest and silk under-kimono, secured twice, once
with a cord and then with an under-sash. Next was the kimono itself, right side
folded under the left and then bound at the waist with a cord, the excess
length being pulled up and folded over so that the hem just cleared the toes.
That fold was in turn secured by another waist cord, after which came yet
another under-sash. Now it was ready for the all-important outer sash, the <i>obi</i>,
a heavy silk strip wound around the waist twice, cinched hard, and knotted at
the back, long end up, short end down. Then the long end was folded into a sort
of cloth <i>origami</i>, this one a butterfly, after which it was rolled into a
makeshift tube, into which the short end was stuffed. Finally this <i>obi </i>sculpture
was secured with yet another waist cord, knotted in front.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was all done with minute precision, including the rakish
display of a prescribed few millimeters of silk under kimono at the neck, an
erotic touch for traditionalists. Finally she put on special <i>tabi</i>
stockings, bifurcated at the big toe to accommodate her thonged slippers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then they attacked her hair, brushing, spraying, adding</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>ornaments.
The makeover took a good three quarters of an hour and even so it was a rush
job.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the sashes and cords and cinches got ever tighter and more
suffocating, she remembered what wearing a kimono can do to your psyche. The <i>obi
</i>seemed designed to demolish breasts, the multiple waist sashes and cords to
totally immobilize the torso from rib cage to thigh. When Ken finally escorted
her onto the elevator she felt like a walking mummy . . . this, she remembered,
is why a lifelong kimono wearer minces along in short, pigeon-toed steps that
suggest she's been shackled at the knees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Downstairs the kitchen had been placed on war footing, and
what awaited when they entered the <i>tatami </i>banquet room was the tableau
for a full-scale feast. The lacquer table was dotted with delicate rice-straw
mats, on which was marshaled an array of ancient stoneware plates and
cups—rugged black Raku, creamy white Shino, green-tipped Oribe. The <i>kakemono
</i>picture-scroll hanging in the <i>tokonoma</i> was a severe monochrome
landscape in the angular ink style of the great master Sesshu. Was it
authentic? she wondered. Where'd they get it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After a few minutes' wait the stately man she'd first seen on
TV appeared in the doorway and began removing his shoes, surprisingly relaxed
and informal despite the Household guards standing just outside for security.
While everybody bowed to the floor, he greeted Noda—apparently they'd met when
Noda presented the sword—and exchanged a few pleasantries. His speech was now
ordinary Japanese, not the archaic court dialect of the news conference. This
was the real man. Noda bowed politely from time to time, then turned and
introduced his party.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Emperor of Japan, Tam noticed, seemed to have an eye for
the ladies. When her turn came, he was all easy smiles, saying something about
how pleasant it was to meet such a charming American, since he rarely had the
honor. He then complimented her kimono.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After that, His Majesty took the place of highest status, his
back to the <i>tokonoma</i> alcove (traditionally the safest spot to be, since
it was the one location in a room sure to be backed by a solid wall), and
motioned for Noda to sit next to him on the left, the second-highest place of
honor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he nodded toward Tam, calling her his honorable foreign
guest, and asked if she would indulge him by sitting on</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>his right.
She bowed back and took he</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r
 place</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Mori, whose own
kimono was a pattern of delicately shaded autumn leaves, was seated alongside
Noda, while Ken was placed next to Tam. As he was settling everybody, an
important ritual of prestige, the Emperor kept repeating how delighted he was
to meet a real American—his exposure to the outside world these days apparently
consisted mainly of television.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He started things off by toasting Dai Nippon, International
with a saucer of sake, after which he asked Noda to repeat for him again
exactly how the sword had been recovered. Since his late father had been an
ardent marine biologist, he loved the part about the computerized magnetometer
and pressed for all the details.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally the banquet got underway, course after course of a
little sliver of local seafood and an ornamental portion of seasonal vegetable,
everything on some unexpected serving piece. It was a feast of sight as much as
taste. A delicacy called <i>mukozuke </i>came in a black lacquer bowl, <i>hassun</i>
on a bamboo tray, <i>hashiarai </i>in a brown Raku cup, <i>konomono </i>in a
weathered earthen dish, <i>yakimono</i> on a gray Oribe platter tipped with
green. The sake pot was cast-iron, sixteenth-century, with a pale turquoise
porcelain top. They all drank from saucers of crusty white Shino ware—the
Emperor's tipped in gold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By then Tam's legs had begun to ache. She knew that sitting
in formal Japanese style, on the heels, can eventually induce what seems like
semi-paralysis of the lower extremities. As she glanced around, she decided
that only Ken, who'd told her he was accustomed to kneeling traditional style
for hours practicing the tea ceremony, actually seemed comfortable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally the table was cleared for the famous specialty of the
spa, which His Majesty had specifically requested. It was an ornate <i>yosenabe</i>,
a lusty Japanese bouillabaisse of artfully sculptured components, each of which
signified some episode in the fateful battle of Dan-no-ura—in fact, the very
engagement in which the sword was lost. That was eight hundred years ago, Tam
reminded herself, yet you'd think it was only last week.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were just concluding the meal with the traditional
serving of <i>gohan</i> or rice when the manager of the spa entered and
announced that their special entertainer was now ready. He apologized that,
although he could offer nothing truly worthy of His Majesty, his humble spa had
brought from </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> a performer he hoped would not be
judged too harshly. He then ordered more sake sent in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Although drinking more sake after a banquet's closing round
of <i>gohan</i> is normally judged impolite, His Majesty just smiled and
thanked their flustered host. Around went the small flagons once more, maids
scraping the <i>tatami </i>with their foreheads as they refilled the Emperor's
gold-trimmed saucer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the <i>fusuma</i> parted and the evening's surprise
swept into the room, wearing an austere autumn kimono of finest silk and
holding a <i>shamisen</i>, a three-stringed instrument with a cat-skin face and
gold fittings. Her lips were vermilion, her lacquered wig coal-black, her face
chalk. As she bowed low before His Majesty, only one visage in the room was
paler than hers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was, Ken whispered to Tam with great delight, none other
than Matsuo Noda's former &quot;protégée,&quot; Koriko.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After she had bowed low before the Emperor, she greeted the
president and CEO of Dai </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Nippon</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> as though he were merely another
guest. He nodded and mumbled back a reply both curt and incomprehensible. Next
she tossed a mildly flirtatious acknowledgment to Ken, who returned her wink
and toasted her with his sake saucer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That ended the formalities, since she treated the women in
the room as though they were composed of thin air. Their presence violated all
tradition, an embarrassment that could be papered over, Japanese style, simply
by pretending they didn't exist. Tam could have cared less, while the pained
face of Akira Mori indicated she was positively relieved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Koriko took immediate command of the room with an easy poise
that confirmed her professionalism. Tam guessed she was pushing forty but knew
that aficionados of geisha prefer talent over youth. Using a large ivory
plectrum, Koriko strummed her <i>shamisen</i> twice, its wound-silk strings
piercing and whiny, then began a high-pitched song from her ancient repertoire.
Tam couldn't follow the words and doubted if anybody else could either.
However, she knew it was the convention that counted. Then at a dramatic moment
two more geisha entered with a flourish and began a classical dance, all fans
and rustling silk. It was a stunning floor show for those who appreciate
slow-motion poses and flirtatiously exposed napes of neck. Between dances
Koriko urged more sake on the men, joked with His Majesty and with Ken, and
induced them both to sing a racy song. Noda, who sat there glaring, was
diplomatically ignored.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For her own part, Tam was finding this traditional
&quot;geisha party&quot; extremely juvenile and silly. Was this what supposedly
intelligent Japanese businessmen consider the height of refined amusement, all
this fake flattery and cajoling, mixed with not a few ribald double entendres?
How depressing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After a few more songs and dances Koriko and her ensemble
began preparing to depart, whereupon His Majesty presented her with a small
gift, or perhaps an honorarium, wrapped in gold paper and tied with an
elaborate purple bow. In keeping with etiquette she didn't open it, merely
thanked him graciously and tucked it into her obi. She then caressed the ivory
pegs of her shamisen with reverence, saying she would treasure it forever as
the unworthy instrument that had solaced the ears of His Imperial Majesty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With a final bow to Noda, never hinting she knew him, she
backed out the door and was gone, followed by the others. His look of relief
reminded Tam of a man who'd just walked away from a collapsing building.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whatever may have been Tam's, or Matsuo Noda's, secret
thoughts about Koriko, the Emperor clearly had had a rollicking time.
Presumably he didn't have all that many occasions to flirt with geisha. Now
slightly the worse for sake, he began to wax pensive, turning to his American
guest and offering to provide an account of the battle of Dan-no-ura. It was a
definite switch of mood, but Koriko's traditional songs seemed to have struck a
nostalgic nerve. Or perhaps the sword had brought him a new enthusiasm for the
past he wanted to share. As he started recounting the battle, Tam smiled to
think it was like having the Queen herself brief you on that family squabble of
yesteryear called the War of the Roses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That battle, Richardson-san, between the Heike and
Genji clans, was a turning point in the long history of our country; it
represented the rise to power of the warriors. The shogunate.&quot; He smiled
politely. &quot;I'm afraid the monarchy never quite recovered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In fact, today the crabs in the </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Inland Sea</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> have a mark on the back of their
shells that people say is like the insignia of the Heike, that they represent
the fallen banners of the Heike nobles.&quot; He paused while a maid topped off
his tiny cup with more hot sake. &quot;I suppose you've seen them?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Hai, miraremashita</i>.&quot; Of course, she nodded,
stretching</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>out her
vowels to maximum politeness. She wasn't sure she had actually, but this was no
time to appear like a dumb <i>gaijin</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Well, after many years of fighting, the Heike
nobles and the boy emperor they were defending fled to an island across the Inland
 Sea. But the Genji forces pursued them and eventually they were forced to take
to their boats once more. Finally the battle was joined. Since the Heike were
experienced sailors, they assumed they would prevail in a naval encounter, and
thus their commander unwisely elected to make his stand in the straits, where
the riptide was as quick and treacherous then as it is today. At first he had
the tide in his favor and they held the enemy, but around noon the tide changed and was against them. Gradually the forces of the Genji surrounded the ship
bearing the emperor and the court.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His voice faltered slightly, and she realized the story was
still as fresh for him as if it had happened yesterday. Finally he continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As the sad story is told in the Heike Monogatari, the
court nobles saw a school of dolphins coming toward them. They said, 'If these
turn back, the Genji will be destroyed and we will triumph. If they proceed, it
will be a bad omen.' When the dolphins continued on, even diving under their
ships, the Heike realized they were lost. And sure enough, at that moment the
Genji ships began closing in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now the tragic part. The nurse of the boy emperor—
Antoku was only eight—resolved what she would do. She donned a double outer
dress of dark gray, the color of mourning, tucked up the long skirts of her
heavy silk <i>hakama </i>robe, and wrapped the sacred sword in her girdle.
Then, taking young Antoku in her arms, she moved to the gunwale of the vessel
and looked down at the waves. Finally she said to the men of the court, Though
I am only a woman, I will not surrender myself to our enemies. I will accompany
our Sovereign Emperor on his journey.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;At that moment little Antoku looked up, his long black
hair streaming down his back, and asked, 'Where are you taking me?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tears began to flow down her cheeks. She said to him,
'Bow to the east and bid your farewell to the Great Shrine at Ise. Our capital
will no longer be </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> but a place beneath the seas, where
there is no sorrow.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So the young Antoku, his white robes the color of the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>dove, bowed
east to Ise—whereupon the nurse, holding him in one arm and the sacred sword in
the other, leapt into the waves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Next, another woman tried to jump overboard with the
casket holding the sacred mirror, but an arrow pinned her <i>hakama</i> to the
gunwales, and the Genji soldiers retrieved it. All we know of what happened
next is the dispatch they sent back to the new rulers in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, which declared, 'The former emperor is at the bottom
of the sea, and the sacred mirror has been recovered. But the sword is lost and
a search is being made.'&quot; He turned and nodded toward Noda. &quot;Only
tonight, eight centuries later, can the rest be told. At last, the sword has
been restored to Us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda bowed low and offered a toast to the Imperial line.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was then that Akira Mori first spoke. Although she
addressed her words to Tam, they were obviously meant for His Majesty.
&quot;Richardson-san, recovering the sword is a more important historical event
than many realize. Its loss coincided with the end of Imperial power in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. After that, the emperor became a figurehead, a
captive of the shoguns.&quot; She shot a quick glance at Noda. &quot;If the
sword means nothing else, it should remind us all that no shogun must ever be
allowed to rise again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What's she driving at? Tam wondered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course.&quot; His Majesty took up the theme.
&quot;Although there was a time in this century when the militarists once again
made a tool of the emperor of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, I agree it was wrong.&quot; He
looked at Mori with admiration. &quot;The respect your words show for the
Imperial house of Yamato touches me deeply.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While she bowed in acknowledgment, he turned to Noda.
&quot;In the same manner, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Noda-san</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>'s important place in the modern world brings special respect
to Us as well. For that We must thank you and all those helping to fashion the
new </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam watched Noda, puzzling. Something was going on, some kind
of coded cross-talk she didn't fully comprehend. Shogun. Emperor. What was
everybody's unspoken agenda?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that point His Majesty rose unsteadily and announced he
had a heavy day ahead, whereupon he summarily bade everyone good evening and
exited, Imperial Household guards in attendance. Tam noticed that Mori watched
his departure with a wistful . . . worshipful, gaze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After he was gone, a reverent stillness settled around them.
Even Ken, normally talkative, was subdued. What's going on here? she puzzled.
One thing was sure: </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> was like a magical onion, with
layers to be peeled away slowly. Each time you learn something new, yet you
never really get to the core.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When the last dishes had been cleared and nothing remained on
their low table except fresh kettles of sake, Noda leaned back and broke the
silence. She realized he was speaking to her. Matsuo Noda, it quickly came to
light, was fully familiar with her books.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But that was merely the beginning. Next, Akira Mori, who'd
been quietly waiting her turn, joined in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Were you moved by the story of the nurse who threw
herself into the waves, Richardson-san? The one who sacrificed her own life to
honor her ideals?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It was a very touching account.&quot; Tam looked at
her, surprised by the sudden friendliness. &quot;I understand even more now why
everybody's so excited about the sword.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Presumably you know,&quot; Mori continued evenly,
&quot;that the young emperor's nurse was undoubtedly Fujiwara. Perhaps of low
rank, but nonetheless a member of the family that historically has been closest
to the throne.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course, the Fujiwara were always Imperial
retainers—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you taken no interest in that family?&quot; Mori
continued, her face still revealing nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I . . . no, not really?&quot; Tam studied her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps you should, Dr. Richardson.&quot; She switched
to flawless English. &quot;Are you aware that your own mother was Fujiwara? In
fact, it is possible that in your veins runs the same blood as the nurse who
gave her life for the emperor that April day eight hundred years ago.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam felt a numbness sweep over her. She'd never thought much
about her real mother, or father. Naturally there would have been no way of
tracing him, at least none she knew. But of course there'd be full records of
the woman who bore her, then put her up for adoption. For some reason Mori—or
was it Noda himself?—had had them looked up. They'd uncovered something about
her that she herself had never wanted, for well-examined reasons, to explore.
Her adoptive parents had been all anybody could desire. Why stir up unknowns?
Besides, she believed in nurture, not nature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You both seem to know a great many things about
me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Her glance
shifted back and forth between them. She was surprised, yes, but if they'd
assumed she'd be stunned, they were wrong. She'd decided long ago not to let
herself care.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Although your true mother no longer lives, you are most
certainly Fujiwara,&quot; Mori went on. &quot;You have blood ties with the
family that once stood ready to give its life for the emperor. Therefore you
may even have a connection with the sword itself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda moved in. &quot;We also believe, Dr. Richardson, that
you, because of your work, could have a vital role in the endeavor Dai Nippon
will soon undertake. That is the reason we want to speak with you
tonight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At last, Tam thought. I'm finally going to find out why
Matsuo Noda &quot;accidentally&quot; happened to ask me along.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've been waiting to hear this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since the <i>fusuma </i>sliding doors were drawn closed,
shutting out the serving women, Noda breached conventional etiquette and
reached across the table to pour more sake into Tam's tiny Shino dish himself.
Ken merely looked on silently as Mori took up Noda's theme.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We would like you to be part of something that would do
honor to your Fujiwara heritage, Dr. Richardson, the noble family that so long
served the emperor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I may or may not be Fujiwara, Mori-san, but I already
have my work.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Richardson, do hear us out,&quot; Noda interjected,
pressing. &quot;We wish to advise you that important, even potentially
disruptive events, lie ahead for </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
Very soon. And we would like very much for someone such as yourself, a
pragmatist, to be involved. Especially since, in addition to your professional
skills, you are in a position to understand the cultures, the attitudes, of
both Americans and Japanese. Your assistance could be invaluable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Invaluable for what purpose?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A worthy undertaking, we assure you. Think of it if you
will as an attempt to prevent </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and the West from going to war with
each other again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked back and forth between the two of them, trying to
fathom what they were driving at. Then Noda continued, revealing again that
nothing had happened by chance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We brought you here today to Ise to remind you of the
importance of your Japanese heritage. A heritage whose sole</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>purpose is,
like Shinto itself, the peace and ordering of the world.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's this all about?&quot; She looked at Ken, in a
black silk kimono, serenely sipping his sake and looking the essence of
cultivated, tantalizing otherness. &quot;Did you have anything to do with
this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He carefully set down his Shino dish and smoothed his long
sleeve. &quot;I did have occasion to remind Noda-sama that you have a unique
combination of background and expertise, Tamara, that could be very
instrumental in the realization of his objectives.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what are his objectives?&quot; She looked back at
Noda. &quot;Your objectives?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You, Dr. Richardson, should appreciate this better than
anyone.&quot; He studied his sake saucer. &quot;There are things the West
excels at doing, and there are areas, I trust it is not improper to say, in which
we Japanese have demonstrated aptitude. Why should we compete in each other's
spheres? It leads only to divisiveness. We open ourselves to predators— from
the steppes of the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Caucasus</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> to the oil-rich deserts of Araby.
But if we join together, the peoples of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
and </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> can achieve insurmountable
strength.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're talking about something that would more properly
be in the realm of diplomacy, Noda-san.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He laughed. &quot;Pardon me, Dr. Richardson, but diplomacy is
merely the window dressing for reality. The world cares not a penny for
diplomacy, only for power. No one troubled about the </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Persian Gulf</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> states until they had OPEC and the
rest of us had no petroleum. Then suddenly they were toasted worldwide as men
of great moment. That is the meaning of 'diplomacy.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The reason I knew you would understand the importance
of Ise,&quot; he went on, &quot;is that, in your genes, you are part of us. You
appreciate the value of harmony, one of the first teachings of our philosophy.
There must be harmony between man and his world.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What does that—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Please, just allow me to finish. In like manner, there
must also be harmony between nations. Yet all we hear about today is friction.
Usually trade friction. Between our nations. But what can be done? The
solutions we hear talked of seem, for reasons political and otherwise,
impossible to implement. So what course does that leave? You speak of
diplomacy, but already diplomacy has been shown inadequate. Why, we might ask,
is that so? Because, as your Thomas Jefferson observed many years ago, money is
the principal exchange of civilized nations. Diplomacy comes out of economic
power. It was trade that estranged our two nations once before in this century,
leading to a conflict neither of us desired, and it is money that creates these
'frictions' we hear about so much today. Since diplomacy has failed, we must
now find other means to bring stability and thus harmony to both our
nations.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was tempted to ask him how all the right-wing,
nationalistic fervor he was churning up with the sword would contribute to this
so-called harmony, but instead she inquired what, specifically, he was
proposing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The most pressing problem </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> has today, Dr. Richardson, is the
growing inability of your industries to compete. If I may be allowed to generalize:
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s strength has long been in
innovation, but I think it is reasonable to suggest that Japanese management
has had a commensurate share of success. So much so that we have been the
subject of a flurry of books in your country.&quot; He smiled. &quot;Even, I
should add, several very insightful volumes written by you yourself. Also,
Japanese industry has already been part of a number of joint ventures,
instituting our management techniques in the service of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s business.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, unquestionably we do have problems in our
industrial sector just now,&quot; Tam interjected. &quot;But </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> has plenty of difficulties of its own.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Most assuredly.&quot; He nodded. &quot;However, as some
might put it, 'the proof is in the pudding.' I merely ask you to compare your,
and our, balance of trade, or productivity. Surely these both suggest there is
truth in what I say.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that point Akira Mori abruptly seized the floor. &quot;You
know, Dr. Richardson, there are those in your country who are now saying your
trade problems are caused by </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. That we should work less, save
less, squander more, just as you do. Perhaps so we will self-destruct
economically as </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> is now doing and no longer be an
embarrassment to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is hardly—&quot; Noda tried to break in, but she
waved him aside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, this needs to be said. I am tired of hearing
Americans tell us to follow their example.&quot; She turned back. &quot;Your
media</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>chastise us
for our thrift and hard work, while your businessmen, who are happy enough to
grow rich retailing the superior goods we make, refuse to invest their profits
in modernizing their own factories. Instead they give themselves bonuses and
Japan lectures.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that she wound down, to the obvious relief of Noda and
Ken. The outburst seemed to pass as quickly as it had come, but it succeeded in
reinforcing </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tarn</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s reservations about Akira Mori.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what exactly do you have in mind?&quot; She looked
back at Noda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Richardson, no one in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> desires to see </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s
industrial base disintegrate. That is dangerous for the future, both yours and
ours. Yet joint ventures and management seminars are too little, too late. We,
and by 'we' I mean Dai Nippon, are determined to make a more structured
contribution.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he laid out his plan, she realized that Matsuo Noda had
decided to play God. Still, in this world such things were possible; all it
took was enough financial clout. If anybody doubted that, just remember OPEC.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But that was the last time around. Now </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> had the money. Maybe the oil billionaires of years
past had no good idea what to do with their winnings, but Matsuo Noda had a
very precise idea indeed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The one remaining problem: he needed Tamara Richardson.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:1.0pt;color:windowtext'><img

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the aftermath of that evening down in Ise, Tam was
convinced of only one fact. Nobody was giving her the straight story. Not Noda,
not Mori, not Ken. And when she tried to talk supercomputers with MITI
officials at the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> conference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>she again
sensed she was hearing a runaround. Suddenly all she could get was </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s public face, that version of reality Japanese
executives call <i>tatemae</i>, superficial and soothing assurances, intended
to promote the <i>wa</i>, harmony, so desirable in human affairs. When </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> doesn't care to give answers, <i>hai</i> no longer
translates as &quot;yes.&quot; It just means &quot;I heard you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Even more troublesome was the question of Ken. As best she
could tell, he was merely a reluctant accomplice in Noda's grand design. But
why was he going along with Dai Nippon if he was as apprehensive as he seemed?
Ken, she concluded, knew a lot more about Matsuo Noda than he was saying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So instead of giving them all an answer outright, she decided
to spend a few days analyzing what she'd managed to piece together so far. As
Noda had couched his proposition, it was simple: he was offering her a chance
to do more than merely write prescriptions for </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>'s economic recovery. She would guide it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One thing, Matsuo Noda was no proponent of half measures. The
way he laid out his scenario, it was visionary . . . no, revolutionary. After
thinking over his proposal for a week, she still wasn't sure whether he was
brilliant or a megalomaniac. Dai Nippon's program could conceivably change the
course of world history, and the prospect of being at the helm of its
juggernaut was seductive. All the same, what if Ken's hints were right? What if
Noda did have something much grander in mind, something impossible even to
imagine. When you ride the whirlwind, who's really in charge?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In between her visits to the conference she spent some time
at DNI's </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> offices getting acquainted with
Noda's operation—the computers, fiber-optic links, analysts. Very impressive.
Although Dai Nippon was technically only a shell corporation, all Matsuo Noda
had to do was pick up a phone to have at his disposal the expertise of any one
of a hundred Japanese corporate brain trusts. Half of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s new high-tech movers, it seemed, owed him some kind
of &quot;obligation.&quot; Given that, and all the money, he could well be
unstoppable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Also, the austerity of Dai Nippon's offices reminded her once
again that none of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s new power was accidental. The
discipline of the samurai. It was almost as though this country had been in
training for centuries, toughening itself through self-denial and work-as-duty
to be ready for an all-out economic blitz. Now, finally, </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> had an edge on the entire world. More technology and
more money.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was Noda about to just give away that edge? The
implausibility made her certain something was missing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Late that Friday, the conference over, she and Ken packed their
bags and checked out of the International. But after they'd shoved their way
through the usual pandemonium in the lobby and hailed a cab, he gave the driver
the name of a place on </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Shinmonzen
  Street</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, the antique
district. Not the train station. When she tried to correct him, he waved his
hand and said he'd arranged for a surprise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, the International always leaves a bad taste in my
mouth. It has nothing to do with </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
It could be anywhere, just like some Hilton next to a freeway.&quot; He smiled
and lightly patted her hand. &quot;Let's not go back to </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> just yet. Please. This weekend let's stay at a place
where nothing will exist but you and me, not even time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just turn off the clocks?&quot; Sounded like a great
idea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, now and then it's nice to turn them down a bit,
don't you think?&quot; He laughed self-consciously. &quot;That's a
contradiction about me you'll someday have to get used to. I like a high-tech
office, but when I'm away I prefer to be surrounded by things that are very,
very old.&quot; He leaned back. &quot;Indulge me. Let me show you my favorite
spot in all of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. A place time forgot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This is going to be quite a trick, she told herself. Very
little was left from years past. Maybe the city hadn't been bombed out during
the war, but the blitz of urban renewal was rapidly accomplishing much the same
result. Through the light of dusk, construction cranes loomed above the few
remaining thatched roofs of neighborhoods about to be overwhelmed by steel,
glass, cinderblock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kenji Asano, it turned out, deplored this immensely. As they
rode along, he pointed out the latest construction sites with the sorrow of a
man documenting the end of civilization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This, we hear, is the price of progress. I'm always
tempted to ask, progress toward what?&quot; He leaned back with a sigh and lit
a Peace cigarette, nonfilter. &quot;Someday I think we may have to ask
ourselves if this modern world we've created for ourselves was actually worth
the toll it's taken on our sensibilities.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Eventually their taxi pulled into a narrow side street, edging
past a few women carrying small bundles of groceries bound in scarves, then
easing to a stop before the ramshackle bamboo gates of a place that seemed
abandoned to foliage and vines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The driver helped carry their bags in through the gates and
up the rocky, hedge-lined pathway leading to a wooden veranda. Ahead was a
thatch-roofed, weathered house shrouded by towering elms. As they approached,
an elderly woman in a dark kimono emerged from the recesses of the interior.
She sang out a welcome, bowed deeply, and produced two pairs of leather
slippers with an air of ritual solemnity. They were expected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Off went the street shoes, on went the slippers as they
melted into a world that would have been perfectly natural four centuries ago.
When they passed the &quot;lobby&quot;—off to the side, <i>tatami</i>-floored,
with a few ancient screens scattered about—Tam noticed that there appeared to
be no &quot;desk.&quot; But there was also no &quot;check in&quot;; the
proprietress clearly knew the honorable Asano-san. She also must have known he
was with MITI, since her honorifics soared into the upper reaches of politeness
as she guided them along the interior hallway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam realized they were in a traditional Japanese inn, a <i>ryokan</i>,
surely the last vestige of classical </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
As they moved out onto another veranda, this one circling a central garden and
pond, the place appeared to be totally empty. The woodland vista in the center
hinted of infinity, with stone paths and a wide pool dotted with shapely rocks.
Although there were a dozen or so closed doors along the wooden platform, the
inn seemed to be there solely for them. In the cool dusk clumps of willows
across the pond masked the view of the other side, furthering the illusion that
they had the place all to themselves. It couldn't be true, though, since
chambermaids in kimono darted here and there balancing lacquered dinner trays.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When they reached the end of the veranda, their hostess
paused before a set of <i>shoji </i>screens, knelt, and pushed aside the
rice-paper covered frames to reveal a room entirely bare except for a low
lacquer table. Well, not quite: on the back wall was the traditional picture
alcove, <i>tokonoma</i>, in which a seventeenth-century ink-wash scroll hung
above a weathered vase holding three spare blossoms. Their room had no keys, no
clocks, no television. It was a cocoon for the spirit, a place of textured
woods, crisp <i>tatami</i>, lacquer, and rice-paper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The woman deposited their bags on the black-bordered <i>tatami</i>,
consulted briefly with Ken concerning dinner, then backed, bowing, out of the room,
leaving them alone together in another time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, this is perfect. I needed someplace like
this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We both did.&quot; He embraced her. &quot;They're
running our tub now. Afterward I have another surprise for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Allow me some mystery.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whatever he had planned, she couldn't wait to throw off her
clothes, don a loose cotton <u>yukata </u>robe, and pad with him down to the
little wood-lined room where their steaming bath awaited. The floor was red
tile, the walls scented Chinese black pine, the massive tub cedar with rivulets
of steam escaping through cracks in its cypress cover.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While they perched on little stools beside the tub, he soaped
her back, occasionally dousing her with the bucket of lukewarm water. Then she
did the same for him, watching half mesmerized as the soapy bubbles flowed off
his shoulders, broad and strong. Almost like an athlete's. Finally they climbed
in, and amidst the cloud of vapor her last remaining tensions melted away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, I think of you every time I come to </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, wanting to lure you back.&quot; He reached for the
brush and began to gently massage her neck. &quot;I honestly never dreamed
Matsuo Noda would come along and try to hire you.&quot; He paused. &quot;I wish
I could help you make your decision. But the most I can do is warn you to be
careful.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What are you telling me? she wondered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, you seem troubled about something. What is
it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tamara, powerful forces are at play here, beyond the
control of either of us. Things may not always be what they seem. Just be aware
of that. But please don't ask me any more. Just look out for yourself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've had a lifetime of looking out for myself. I can
handle Matsuo Noda.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just don't ever underestimate him. He's not like anyone
you've ever known before. The man is pure genius, probably the most visionary,
powerful mind in the history of this country. You've met your match.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That remains to be seen.&quot; She leaned back. Ken was
challenging her now. On purpose? Maybe he figured that was</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>the only
bait she would rise to. He wanted her to play along with Noda, but he wouldn't
tell her why.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After they'd simmered to medium rare, heading for well done,
they climbed out, toweled each other off, slipped back into their yukatas once
again, and glided back to the room. She noticed that an interior screen had
been pushed aside, opening onto another <i>tatami</i> room where a thin futon
mattress had already been unrolled and prepared with white sheets and a thick
brocade coverlet. Hot tea waited on their little lacquer table, but their bags
had disappeared. She checked behind a pair of sliding doors and saw that all
her things had been neatly shelved by some invisible caretaker. Even the
clothes she'd been wearing were already hung in the closet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now for my surprise.&quot; He was slipping on a black
silk kimono. &quot;They have a special little garden here that only a few
people know about. I've arranged everything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shouldn't I change too for whatever it is we're
doing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Theoretically, yes. But formality doesn't suit
you.&quot; He cinched his <i>obi</i>. &quot;Come on. You can be formally
informal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He led the way to the end of the veranda where they
each put on the wooden clogs that were waiting. Then they passed through a
bamboo gate into yet another landscape, this one lit by candles set in stone
lanterns. At the back stood a small one-room structure of thatch, reed, and
unfinished wood. A teahouse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, can you sit here for a second, in the waiting
shelter?&quot; He indicated a bench just inside the gate under a thatch
overhang. &quot;I'll only need a few minutes to prepare.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Off he went, clogs clicking along a string of stones nestled
in among the mossy floor of the garden. He was following the <i>roji</i>, the
&quot;dewy path&quot; that led to the teahouse half hidden among the trees at
the back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Unlike the <i>ryokan<sup>’</sup> s </i>larger garden, this
one had no water; it was meant to recall a mountain walk. The space was small,
with natural trees, offering no illusion of being more than it was. But it was
a classic setting for tea, a kind of deliberate &quot;poverty.&quot; While she
watched the flickering stone lanterns and listened to the night crickets, the
cacophony of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> could have been eons away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally Ken appeared beside the doorway of the teahouse and
signaled her forward. As she moved along the stepping stones, she noticed that
the pathway had been swept clean of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>falling
leaves, after which the gardener had strewn a few back to give it <i>wabi</i>,
an unaffected natural look. The art of artlessness, she thought, as she paused
at a stone water basin to rinse her mouth from its bamboo dipper, part of the
preparatory ritual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The <i>cha-no-yu </i>or &quot;tea ceremony,&quot; she knew,
required almost a lifetime to master completely. It was a seated ballet of
nuance and perfect clarity of motion. One awkward gesture and its carefully
orchestrated perfection could be spoiled. She hoped she could remember the rules
well enough to get it right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ken was already seated across from her, tending a small
charcoal brazier sunk into the <i>tatami</i>-matted floor. From its light she
could just make out the room's rough-hewn timbers, the straw and mud walls,
bark and bamboo ceiling. A small calligraphy scroll hung in the <i>tokonoma</i>
alcove. As he beckoned her formally to sit, the room was caught in an unearthly
silence, the only sound the sonorous boiling of the kettle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ken was profoundly transformed, almost like another being.
Warm and attentive only minutes before, now he was part of a different world,
solemn and remote. The black silk of his kimono seemed to enforce the
seriousness in his dark eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She watched as he ritually wiped a thin, delicately curved
bamboo scoop with a folded cloth, first touching the handle, then the uptilted
end, after which he balanced it atop the lacquer tea caddy. Next he lifted the
tea bowl, an earth-tone glaze that shifted from mauve to brown as he rotated it
in his hand and wiped the rim. Finally he swabbed the bottom and positioned the
bowl on the <i>tatami</i> in front of him. Now the utensils had been formally
cleansed. He was ready. From the tea caddy he spooned a mound of jade-green
powdered tea and tapped it into the bowl. Then another, this last with a carefully
prescribed twist of the scoop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next he extracted a dipperful of boiling water from the iron
kettle and measured a portion into the bowl, lifted the bamboo whisk sitting
inverted beside the bowl, and commenced a vigorous blending. The tea
immediately began to resemble a pale green lather. Still no words, no sound
save the whir of his whisk intruded upon the quiet of the room. It was a moment
hundreds of years old, framed in silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The economy of ideal form. That, she found herself thinking,
was what this was all about: how flawlessly could you perform what seemed the
most simple, humble act. And he was good. Whereas the mastery in his hands
revealed itself by the control with which he whipped the tea, the rest of his
body remained taut as a spring. Total discipline. Each tiny motion was
distilled to its crystalline essence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At last, when the green froth was ready, he gave the whisk a
final half-turn, then set it aside. Next he lifted the bowl, rotated it in his
hand, and placed it on the mat beside the open charcoal fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His part was over. It was as though the authority had been
passed. Ken had prepared the work; now it was her turn to take up and finish
it. Her role was different yet required its own kind of skill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She bent forward and ceremonially shifted the bowl a short
distance toward her. Then she scooted backward on the tatami and again moved
the bowl closer. Was she doing it right? The flicker in Ken's eyes said yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally, with a bow of acknowledgment, she raised the bowl in
both hands and brought it to her lips. After her first sip she bowed again,
then drank it down as he watched in silent approval. The powdered green tea was
harsh and bitter, just as she remembered from times past. Even for a Japanese
it was difficult to feign appreciation of the musky beverage produced in the <i>cha-no-yu</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>She recalled what was next. With deliberate dignity
she extracted a small napkin from the <i>obi </i>of her loose <i>yukata</i>,
wiped the rim of the bowl, and placed it carefully onto the <i>tatami</i> in
front of her. The motion had to be quick, spare. Ken didn't try to disguise his
pleasure; she had passed some sort of crucial test.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And she told herself, he had too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Together they had joined in one of the most demanding yet
exquisite bonds two people can share. At that moment she felt—was it
imagination?—like an ancient Fujiwara, celebrating some age-old tradition. . .
.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The ceremony was over now. She bowed again, then lifted the
bowl to admire the light crackle in the glaze, the slightly inturned lip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's Raku. I think it's the finest I've ever
seen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;From my collection. It's by the hand of Chojiro, the
seventeenth-century Korean who was in the employ of the Shogun Hideyoshi.&quot;
He smiled. &quot;I had it brought down to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
especially for tonight. For you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm honored.&quot; She was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After she had admired the rest of the utensils—the remaining
formality of <i>cha-no-yu</i>—they both relaxed, their minds purged, their
spirits attuned. Like the ceremony itself, the moment was esthetic and sensual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, this has been a wonderful rebirth for me, being
with you again. You've helped revive in me so many feelings I'd almost
forgotten. The joy of it all. Who could have known?&quot; He leaned back and
reached for a flask of plum wine. Formalities were definitely over. &quot;As
someone once wrote, 'Love. Its roots are deep. Its source unknowable.'&quot; He
was pouring two small glasses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's from the Tsurezuregusa, fourteenth century.
Right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Again you amaze me. You really are Japanese.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I like the poetry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then you know, Tam, our poets excel in feeling. We've always
celebrated emotion over logic.&quot; He smiled. &quot;Which one said, 'Love is
the passion in the heart of man—those who will not listen to reason'?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What does reason have to do with love?&quot; She took a
glass. &quot;Didn't Shakespeare say 'love and reason keep little company
together'?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My turn. That's from Midsummer Night's Dream, which was
. . . sixteenth century. You're pulling out the moderns on me.&quot; He laughed
with delight. &quot;You know, in Heian times, eight hundred years ago here in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kyoto</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, I'd be expected to make a linked verse about the
night now.&quot; He looked out the doorway, then back. &quot;How about . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>The moon
in veil, </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Perfumed
with night, </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Who can
deny love </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>At a time
like this?&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Then his visage quickened, another mood switch. His
eyes mellowed as he turned and carefully lifted the bud from the vase behind
him. It was a camellia, purest white. He held it before him as he turned back,
its long stem still dripping.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, there's a haiku by Basho I love very much.
Let me give it in Japanese . . . a haiku only sounds right in the original.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>time ga

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>yama ji
kana.&quot;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She paused to let the meaning sink in, to feel that open-
ended sensation a good haiku always sends your imagination spinning off into.
&quot;How's this for the English?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>With the
scent of plums</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>on the
mountain road—suddenly,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>sunrise
comes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not bad.&quot; He glanced at the blossom in his hand.
&quot;I don't know why, but the camellia makes me think of you.&quot; He
rotated it carefully, then looked back. &quot;Let's dedicate tonight to our own
sunrise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He inspected the flower again, then impulsively leaned
forward and placed it onto the <i>tatami </i>in front of her. Next, with the
same control in his powerful hands that had touched the glaze of the tea bowl,
he gently gripped the shoulders of her loose <i>yukata</i>. She felt her body
flush with warmth as slowly, gently, his strength once more held in check, he
carefully slid back the cloth off her shoulders until her breasts were free.
Then plucking a petal from the bud, he reverently brushed one nipple, then the
other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was an erotic game she knew he loved, one of many. Games.
Sometimes she had imagined them inhabiting an eighteenth-century <i>shunga</i>,
those woodblock prints picturing lovers in what she had once thought impossible
embraces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd once declared that the kimono was actually the most
sensual garment in the world. Take a look at some of the <i>shunga</i>, he
said, and the possibilities become obvious. Though it seems cumbersome,
entangling, yet it lifts away like a stage curtain to invite all sorts of dramatic
possibilities. The human nude is only interesting when half concealed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Games. She reached and took the petal from him, then ran it
along the silk of his own <i>kimono</i>, over his muscular thighs as he sat,
Japanese-style, feet back. Next she lifted away the silk from the flawless
ivory skin she knew so well. She drew it along his thighs to tease him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam . . .&quot; He reached to slip away her <i>yukata</i>,
but she</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>caught his
hand. Then she touched his lips with her fingers, silencing his protest. She
pushed away his kimono and trailed the petal upward, lightly brushing his own
nipples. Finally she pushed him gently backward and smoothed her cheek against
his thigh, drawing back his kimono even more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The glow of the coals was dying now. As the last shadows
played against his face, she laid the petal on the <i>tatami </i>and moved
across him. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They lingered till the moon was up, then strolled back
through the garden wearing their antique wooden clogs. The air was scented,
musical with the sounds of night. Later that evening they downed an
eight-course meal off antique stoneware plates, drank steaming sake on the
veranda, then made love for hours on the <i>futon</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Around midnight he ordered one more small bottle of
sake, a <i>go</i>, and suggested they move out onto the veranda again, this
time to watch the moon break over the trees. She slipped on her <i>yukata</i>
and padded out. She'd just decided.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Tamara, I want to tell you something.&quot; He
poured her small porcelain cup to the brim. &quot;You are everything Matsuo
Noda is seeking. The way you held the tea bowl tonight, tasted the tea. The <i>cha-no-yu
</i>doesn't lie. You have discipline, our discipline. That's very, very
rare.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean, 'for a <i>gaijin'</i>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;For anyone. Besides, I don't think of you that
way. You are one of us now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked into his eyes, dark in the moonlight. Then she
remembered the <i>tokonoma</i> alcove in the teahouse where a rugged vase had
held the single white bud, its few petals moist as though from dew. Not a
bouquet, a single bud—all the flowers in the world distilled into that one now
poised to burst open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kenji Asano lived that special intensity, that passion, which
set </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> apart from the rest of the world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken.&quot; Her voice was quiet. &quot;I'll do it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean Noda?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Noda.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He said nothing for a moment, then finally he spoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The game begins.&quot;</span></p>

<h1><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>CHAPTER TWELVE</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:1.0pt;color:windowtext'><img
width=32 height=33 src="images/image010.jpg" alt=""></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Over the last three weeks I'd spent long hours on the phone
handling Matsuo Noda's new hedging in the currency markets. The play started
out modestly, but as his Eight Hundred Year funds became bloated with cash, it
grew into an avalanche of speculative positions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His guiding principle was to keep a low profile in order not
to spook the markets, same as any good trader would do. Whenever the FOREX desk
of one market-maker bank on his list would start getting nervous, I'd just hit
the next place in line. Finally after everybody on this side of the ocean began
backing away, he went international. </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Zurich</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
in particular, loved the action and took everything he threw in its direction.
I guess the Swiss are used to high rollers, since their financial casino never
got cold feet and invented a house limit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Somewhere along the way I also came to realize I couldn't
possibly be the only agent in his employ; there was far too much money to move.
Also my list of contracts eventually got pared to manageable levels, so
somebody else had to be picking up the slack. It appeared that just as I was
spreading the action he'd assigned to me all over the globe, he was spreading
his own assignments worldwide. The man had to be covering a major chunk of the
world market in interest-rate futures and currency forwards, but not a penny of
it was traceable to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Or to Matsuo Noda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How, I kept marveling, could this be happening right under
the nose of all our supposed geniuses of world finance? One thing, Noda had all
his moves down pat. My hunch was he'd started routing a lot of short selling
through </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Sydney</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and </span><span style='font-size:
 10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Hong Kong</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>, and also was hitting the off-exchange &quot;third
market,&quot; anyplace he could find somebody to take his bets. If you remember
how the dollar plunged in the mid-eighties, you'll also recall that anybody
who'd had the foresight to dump it in advance would have been sitting pretty.
Plenty of traders did, but none of them received any particular attention,
since the pond is so huge. In cumulative totals the currency exchanges
worldwide easily handle as much as two hundred billion dollars a day. Although
DNI's massive short position clearly signaled that somebody major was
anticipating a crash of the dollar, Noda realized that all he had to do was
keep moving and nobody would put it together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Need I add that my own little dollar hedge for Amy was
peanuts compared to what was going on now. Dai Nippon through its anonymous
agents was dumping American currency in the multi-billions worldwide, but since
Noda kept the action spread out, nobody bothered to notice the pattern. Ditto
his awesome &quot;naked&quot; shorting of Treasury futures. I mean, anybody
who'd troubled to assemble the numbers could have predicted somebody up on the
bridge must have sighted a reef dead ahead. I kept trying to warn traders I
knew, both on and off the exchanges, but nobody wanted to hear downbeat
speculation from some Cassandra. They were all too busy pocketing commissions
and ordering more champagne.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And then it happened. In broad daylight. I'll explain the
operative details shortly, but if you were there, that could be a little like
reviewing the theory underlying nuclear fission for somebody standing at ground
zero when the bomb hit. So first let me recollect how it felt down in the
trenches.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was breakfasting at the dining room table downstairs that
particular Monday morning—November 7, as we all remember so vividly—when Matsuo
Noda dropped the first shoe, or maybe it's more accurate to say he began
loosening the laces. I'd just finished squeezing some orange juice when I
punched in the number of a financial update service on my trusty cordless
phone, mainly to hear the (recorded) sound of a human voice. I'd totally
forgotten the U.S. Treasury was holding its quarterly refunding that day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Newsbreak. Dealer banks were reporting that demand for the
long bond, the thirty-year, was extremely soft to nonexistent. Equally
unnerving, there wasn't any noticeable interest in Treasury's ten-year notes
either. The reason seemed to be that the usual heavy participation by major
Japanese investment houses (typically twenty to forty percent of the total) had
inexplicably evaporated. In fact, a rumor currently flying across</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>the floor of
the Chicago Board of Trade said a number of Japanese securities houses and
banks in New York had begun what appeared to be a program to divest their
current Treasury holdings massively. Since spokespersons at Japanese outfits
like Nomura and Daiwa Securities had clammed up, refusing to deny that rumor,
the usual institutional buyers like Oppenheimer and Goldman, Sachs were holding
back, nervous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hang on, I said to myself. Can this mean we're about to test
out </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s &quot;worst case&quot; scenario,
that Japanese pullout all the analysts say could never happen? But there's no
reason. No sudden icebergs out ahead. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda. I said the word out loud. Noda's kicked off his play.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I almost laughed at the thought of his naivete. Was this
going to be his game? Who was he planning to fool? For once you've got a little
surprise in store, chum. Treasury may have to sweeten the pot, but there's a
lot of money in the world. The </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>United
  States of America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
can't be blackmailed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I glanced out at the blue morning sky, empty except for
a single swooping sparrow, and had a strange premonition, one of those mystical
moments when everything sparkles with crystalline clarity. I had this feeling I
can't explain. Still in a reverie I carefully set down my orange-juice glass,
walked upstairs to the &quot;office,&quot; and dialed one of the computers into
Reuters's Wall Street service. How were the securities markets taking the news?
It was already ten-thirty, time enough for some initial response.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dear God. For a second or so I just stared at the numbers in
disbelief. What was happening? Noda hadn't gone near the stock market.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I quickly switched on the TV and located CNN, which was
already carrying a special report live from the floor of the New York Stock
Exchange. There stood a badly shaken Lou Dobbs, minus his tie. Minus, in fact,
his jacket. The scene around him was pandemonium.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;. . . and the Dow Jones Average . . .&quot;—he glanced
down at a monitor—&quot;. . . has dropped six hundred and eighty points in the
last twenty minutes. . . .&quot; At that moment somebody jostled against the
cameraman, giving us a momentary view of the ocean of paper buy-and-sell slips
littering the floor. &quot;A hundred and ninety million shares have already
changed hands in the first half hour of trading this morning. ...&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, I thought, the market is in free-fall. Was Meltdown
Monday in '87 just the warm-up?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As yet unconfirmed rumors concerning a slow foreign
response to today's Treasury auction . . .&quot;—although he was weighing his
words carefully to give the appearance of calm, the hasty makeup on his
forehead was already beginning to bubble with perspiration— &quot;. . . seem to
be responsible for what most analysts are describing as an entirely
inappropriate overreaction in securities prices here this morning. ...&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What else could he say? It was as though everybody's gnawing,
primal fear had just been confirmed. There really was a hairy beast lurking in
the bedroom closet, waiting to jump out and eat us in our sleep. The market was
running to mommy: safe and soothing cash.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next he made the tactical error of buttonholing a couple of
floor traders and specialists for comments. They didn't bother to mince words.
Their one, terrified question: Had Japan finally decided to let the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and its towering debt just twist slowly in the wind?
If that happened, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> capital would simply dry up, sucked
in by Treasury's massive money-sponge: interest rates would soar, murdering the
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> economy. The Great Depression of the
nineties.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I watched, a bulletin started running across the bottom of
the screen: bids on the new issue of thirty-year bonds had now dropped an
amount equivalent to raising their return almost two full interest points. I
zeroed in as the text continued. Worse news. The &quot;coverage ratio,&quot;
which measures how many more bidders there are than necessary, had plummeted
from 2.7 to 1.3. And still dropping. More and more potential buyers were
running for cover.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Lou, who was now surrounded by traders in blue jackets and
couldn't see his own monitor, was assuring his viewers that experienced market
analysts were all saying the slowdown in Treasury action did not accurately
reflect worldwide demand, that deutsche marks and pounds sterling undoubtedly
were already winging westward to take advantage of the new higher rates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sweating there in his melting pancake, the poor guy had no
inkling the patient was slipping into a coma just as he'd forecast full
recovery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, I thought, there's always prayer. Anything's possible.
But . . . as </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> used to say, if frogs had wings,
they wouldn't bump their ass.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I got up to go downstairs and pour another cup of coffee.
Coming back, I decided to forget about the stock market for a moment and just
focus on Treasury, so I clicked on my Telerate service and scrolled through the
financial quotes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Friends, by that time there was no, repeat no, market out
there for Treasury paper. Now that the Japanese dealers appeared to be dumping
everything, European banks had hit the sidelines, waiting to see what
transpired. Would rates continue to move up? Would Treasury be forced to
withdraw the issue? Should everybody be bailing out now before bond prices went
through the deck and demolished years of interest earnings? Looming over it all
was that standing terror of the bond markets: no liquidity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Back to Cable News Network. An officer from one of the dealer
banks (which bid on big chunks of Treasury paper, then retail it) had rushed
over to CNN's midtown studios and was explaining to us all it was clearly
nothing more than some minor trans-Pacific communications snarl. The problem,
obviously, was simple: Japanese securities firms here just hadn't received
authorization from their head offices in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
where it was after business hours. A clarification would be forthcoming any
minute now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, if you've ever been turned down for a mortgage and you
fantasized a day when you'd see that high-and-mighty clerk behind the desk have
to ask <i>you </i>for a loan, I hope you caught that one. This paper-shuffler
whose secretary had a secretary had agreed a week earlier to take on three
billion dollars of Treasury's new debt issues—paper he now couldn't give away,
let alone resell—and he was practically on his knees begging America to save
his bank.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What the hell was going on? My mild-mannered friend Matsuo
Noda had inadvertently (I assumed) kicked off a major financial panic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I clicked the dial over to Financial News Network, FNN, which
had momentarily interrupted its heavy </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>midday</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
fare of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>California</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> snake-oil-and-options hucksters. Now
a decidedly pale investment banker, this one an unindicted employee of Drexel
Burnham, was declaring it was all merely a little &quot;tempest in a
teapot.&quot; His precise words. The Japanese securities houses wouldn't dare
pull out their funds and kill the market, he explained. It was absurd. If they
did that, their investors would lose a fortune, since any big sell-off would
automatically drive down the value of their own massive portfolio. Ergo, </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s funds had no choice but to stay invested. No
problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My friend, I thought, where have </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s bankers been? Out repossessing
some widow's Chevy? As a matter of fact the Japanese outfits here don't give a
flying fig what happens to our debt market. If you'd been doing your job, you'd
know that Matsuo Noda had already sold Treasury futures far in excess of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s portfolio back when values were still high. Now he
can go out and pick up all the notes and bonds he wants, cost approximately
nothing, and turn around and deliver them at yesterday's full price. The man
must feel like a riverboat cardsharp who's lucked into a saloon full of Huck
Finns on payday. Don't you realize he's just cleaned you out, right down to the
fillings in your teeth? And now he's got his team on the bus ready to roll.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Over to CBS, a Special Report underway. It featured a stream
of well-meaning and incoherent Treasury officials, none of whom had the
slightest inkling what to say. Then Jack O'Donnell came on from the Senate
pressroom, breathing fire. The administration's &quot;light at the end of the
deficit tunnel&quot; had turned out to be a freight train heading our way, just
as he'd predicted. </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s debt chickens were coming home to
roost. He was demanding that the Speaker call a joint session of Congress this
very day and by God do something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Right, Jack. What? Looks like our pal Matsuo Noda is about to
have the U.S. of A. exactly where he wants us. By the balls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I guess I must have been operating solely on instinct by
then, because a phone number popped into my head that I hadn't recalled in
years. Sam Kline, my old broker at Merrill Lynch. I hadn't talked to Sam in
ages, but his number used to come to my fingers whenever the market started
acting up. Maybe he was sort of a father figure. Truth is, I'd first learned
what little I know about the market watching that giant ticker ML had up at one
end of the office just above Sam's desk—and long gone in this age of computers.
I remembered how heavy trades—over ten thousand shares—were marked with stars,
always fun to watch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Forget the &quot;financial experts.&quot; They were reduced
to spouting pure gibberish. Time to check in at the real front line. Sam Kline.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe I just wanted to have Sam to soothe me like in the old
days, pour some of that dreadful coffee he had in his Thermos, tug down the
cuffs of his trousers, and say not to worry, there's always tomorrow, the
disaster in my portfolio merely reflected a long-overdue and healthy
&quot;correction&quot; in the market. (Only years later did I finally realize
that &quot;correction&quot; was a special Wall Street expression meaning all
the stocks you own just tanked.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When Sam finally got around to my call, he was barely
coherent but still trying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, what's new?&quot; There was turmoil and yelling
behind him, as though the office was about to go under a wrecking ball.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You tell me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, at the moment it's something of a downside
morning, but—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sam,&quot; I snapped, &quot;this is me, Matt, save the
Pollyanna.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A short pause, and then he crumbled. &quot;Matthew, want the
truth? The Monday Massacre of '87 was a rally compared to this. That crash was
just stocks. This time it's </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> bonds, the dollar, everything. The
market's falling apart. Right this minute the trust departments at First Boston
and Morgan are dumping entire sectors like they were some nervous greenhorn in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Oshkosh</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Pension fund managers I've known
for years are liquidating whole blocks 'at the market,' for whatever they can
get. One specialist downtown just told me he had to eat a hundred thousand
shares of, Christ, General Dynamics. You can't give away Northrop. And
Lockheed, forget it. . . .&quot; Another pause. &quot;God Almighty, Matt, we
need a market up here. How about—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not now, Sam.&quot; It was like hanging up on my own
father. A knife in my heart. &quot;Look, I'll get back to you. Best to
Naomi.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good God. I wanted to hire an airplane and skywrite a big
sign over downtown: WAIT. Trouble was, I wasn't sure myself what it was all
about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>However, there was one thing I could do. I punched in the
contact number for Dai Nippon, uptown, and told the polite little lady who
answered the phone to get Tanaka on the line this goddam minute. About ten
seconds later he was there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you guys nuts?&quot; I yelled. &quot;Doesn't
anybody up there know what's happening?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We are well aware of the situation, Mr. Walton.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, then, do something, for chrissake!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Our securities dealers here are in contact with the
appropriate officials. Nothing is to be done without explicit instructions from
Noda-san. He has not yet been in communication.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, get him in communication.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There is no cause for alarm, Mr. Walton.&quot; He
continued calmly. &quot;Noda-san has made sure that our dealers' exposure in
Treasuries is covered by the futures contracts DNI has acquired. Japanese
investors are sheltered from price fluctuations. Noda-san is most grateful for
your—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Listen carefully,&quot; I said. &quot;Fuck Noda.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I hung up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The rest of the morning I just sat there and watched the
market crater. After bond futures prices on the </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Chicago</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> exchanges had sunk the daily limit, as far as they could
drop in a single session, the action merely moved elsewhere. A cash market
developed off-exchange worldwide and was going crazy, with spot quotes
nose-diving. Prices now were only rumors, but the satellite services were still
trying to track them. At exactly </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>12:37 P.M.</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
the President finally got around to issuing an Executive Order suspending all
trading at the exchanges in government bills, notes, and bonds, including futures
contracts, until further notice. It turned out to have been about as effective
as Prohibition. Besides, by that time I figured Noda had already cleared at
least fifty billion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Enough. I couldn't watch anymore. All of a sudden I felt like
a guy who'd bailed out of his flaming F-16 only to see it total a schoolhouse.
I kicked off the computer, slipped on a suede jacket, and headed for </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bleecker Street</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> to fortify myself with mussels
marinara and a stiff Bloody Mary. The early Post at the corner newsstand
proclaimed with characteristic understatement the imminent passing of the
civilized world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Over cappuccino I finally started to think rationally.
Nothing anybody was saying added up to a full picture. There had to be more, or
less, to the story. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the truth glimmered before my eyes, yet another
transcendental moment. What Noda was planning was obvious. At last I realized
why he'd hired me. Like a great chess player, he could see about ten moves
ahead. The question now was no longer what his next move would be. It was when.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>You want to win World War III with a quick blitzkrieg, knock </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> to its knees? Simple. Go for the
blind side. First you short a piece of the debt market, then for fun you dump
the currency in advance (since it's just naturally gonna go the way of the peso
when you make your opening move, and you might as well squeeze the orange if
it's just lying there anyway). Next you kick things off by giving everybody the
impression you're divesting all Treasury paper, which causes the dollar to
predictably plummet…. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Christ! What about Amy's currency hedge! Three weeks ago I'd
contracted to sell the banks of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>New York</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
ten million dollars she didn't own. In all the pandemonium, I'd completely
forgotten.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I threw down a twenty for the lunch and literally raced
around the corner to look for a pay phone on MacDougal. When I finally found
one that worked, I shoved in a quarter and dialed the FOREX desk at Citibank
for a dollar quote.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
was right. Paper money is predicated on trust. It seems that when the second
largest industrial nation in the world apparently doesn't think enough of the
credit rating of the first largest industrial nation in the world to loan it
two cents, then talk about the full faith and credit of said first largest, etc.,
doesn't cut much ice. The Fed was out there buying dollars and dumping marks
and yen and pounds in the billions to try and keep the dollar afloat, but
nobody else in the Group of Five—those countries supposed to step in and buy
each other's faltering currencies to prop them up—was lifting a finger. In
spite of our treasury secretary yelling fire and damnation, all they'd done was
announce an evening meeting in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Paris</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Period. What, they inquired, had
the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> done lately to help out </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>France</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, or </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Behind our allies' diplomatic and not-so-diplomatic posturing
lay a simple, rhetorical question: Who needed passage on a sinking ship? At the
moment the only thing governments around the world wanted less than U.S.
Treasury debt was U.S. greenbacks. I'd contracted to swap ten million of them
for other currencies back when they were worth a dollar. That afternoon I
settled with bills worth eighty cents and sinking. That's right. Amy's
college-fund hedge cleared two mil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And if you think Miss Amy Walton survived the dollar's crash
intact, what about Matsuo Noda, now holding tens and tens of billions in world
currency forwards?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What didn't prosper that Monday was a state of mind called
Wall Street. By mid-afternoon all the market indexes were down by half;
exchange trading had been halted in a good two- thirds of the Dow stocks; a
major brokerage house had frozen accounts and announced Chapter 11; and gold
futures were soaring. The October crash of '87 was now a nostalgia item,
remembered as a few sessions of light trading with a hint of downside bias.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A lot of investors went to cash, but most switched into money
funds (what else could they do?). While sophisticated players were shorting the
stock indexes and futures, the newsletter gurus—who charged two hundred dollars
a year for hot tips about equal in worth to those of a New York cabbie—were
calling their major clients. A big sell signal was emblazoned in the streets of
lower </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Manhattan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Everybody assumed the situation was
temporary, but nobody needed to ride the ship down. By the closing bell the Dow
had sunk over eleven hundred and fifty points. And don't forget, the DJ Average
represents blue chips; prices for over-the-counter outfits like Widget-tronics
Inc. just packed up and headed south for the winter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The way I figured it, Noda was probably more or less on
schedule. By nightfall the stock exchanges had blood on the floor, a dollar was
worth roughly two-thirds what it had been at sunup, and the U.S. Treasury
couldn't have panhandled a nickel anywhere in the Free World.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I've mentioned Jack O'Donnell a time or so previously, the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Columbia</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>University</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
professor turned politico. Jack was the junior senator from </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>: Irish idealism goes to </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Washington</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. I'd gotten to know him reasonably
well, thanks mainly to a series of rubber-chicken dinners I'd pitched in to
help him with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Needless to say, O'Donnell's well-known attitude toward
fiscal sleight-of-hand in the corporate sector had made raising money on Wall
Street a decidedly uphill endeavor. His Insider of the Month award was
especially unpopular. That was a large gold-plated screw, suitable for
mounting, which he regularly bestowed on any corporate board members who'd just
happened to dump big blocks of their personal holdings about a week before a
disappointing quarterly report sent their company's stock price through the
floor. For some reason Jack never seemed to buy their collective &quot;Gee, we
had no idea&quot; explanation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jack always assumed that corporate managements would walk off
with anything not securely riveted to the floor. He also believed most of the
corporate takeovers these days were about as helpful to </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s competitiveness as masturbation
was to population growth, a viewpoint I tended to share—which is one reason why
I helped him raise money from time to time. More than that, though, I admired
him immensely. The man was a real samurai. Unfortunately, however, he was his
own worst enemy half the time when it came to soliciting campaign checks; he
could never understand why executive dining rooms weren't necessarily the
optimum terrain to start raising hell about shareholders' rights. I once sent
him a dog muzzle for Christmas after he pulled just that trick at a CEO
fundraiser I'd carefully set up in one of those private suites atop the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>World</span><span style='font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd been especially busy this session. When he did come to </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, he spent most of his time up at the
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>West Side</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> apartment of a female aide of his,
where they reportedly were polishing a lot of position papers these days. Monday,
however, he had only one thing on his mind: how to keep the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> monetary system from going belly up. Trouble was, he
had no idea what to do. Naturally he immediately canceled his subcommittee
hearings for the day—an inquiry into how charge cards and the banks touting
them (loving those wonderful loan-shark rates) were lofting consumer debt to
dizzying heights. That afternoon he began working on a speech for the Senate
floor, a hellfire preachment intended to shame the administration into some
kind of action.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After thinking about it awhile, he'd decided that, since all
the nervousness in the market was traceable to an apparently total Japanese
loss of confidence in U.S. government obligations, he'd have his staff call
around concerning what other Japanese moves were underway. He had questions
such as: If they're pulling out of Treasuries, are they dumping corporate bonds
too? Real estate? Where in blazes is it going to stop?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Simple questions, maybe, but tough ones to attack on short
notice, given the clampdown at the source. So his people started making calls,
and finally one of them got hold of Charlie Mercer, an Executive VP at
Shearson. Purely chance. Did Charlie happen to know any big Japanese players in
town?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, yes and no, replied Charlie. Strictly off the record,
one of his biggest personal clients lately was an attorney here in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, who always paid with corporate
checks bearing the logo of a Japanese-sounding outfit. But it was a purely
private arrangement and he was sure . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The staffer immediately told him to please hold while she
switched the call to Senator O'Donnell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Actually I'd known Charlie for years, and I also knew the
poor guy's wife had some kind of esoteric bone cancer that meant ten thou a
month in radiation therapy. So I'd let him set up an account on the side and do
some full commission churning in the name of one of Dai Nippon's dummy fronts.
Why not?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Jack came on the line. &quot;Mr. Mercer, am I to
understand you've been handling heavy trades for a Japanese firm?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing illegal about that, is there, Senator?&quot;
Charlie was growing nervous, suddenly seeing himself under the hot glare of TV
lights in Jack's finance committee. &quot;Truthfully, the man I actually deal
with is an American attorney here named Walton.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt Walton?&quot; roared Jack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know Matthew, Senator?&quot; inquired Charlie,
stunned by the sound of the august public figure abruptly bellowing in his ear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Know him? I may kill the prick for not talking to me
sooner.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Approximately five seconds after this conversation my phone
erupted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell me, Judas,&quot; he yelled, &quot;is it true
you're helping them out? I want the goddamn truth and I want it now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jack?&quot; I finally recognized the voice.
&quot;Helping who?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know who, you fucker. Our good friends the goddam
Japs, that's who. They're—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jack, calm down a second,&quot; I interrupted.
&quot;It's just possible this whole thing is some kind of scam. Not at all what
it seems.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Talk to me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not over the phone. Client confidentiality. But if
you're coming up anytime soon, I'm mad enough to give you a full rundown of all
I know, strictly off the record.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm scheduled in on the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>six o'clock</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> shuttle. Where can we meet?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How about the club? I promise you an earful.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Centurion?&quot; He inquired sourly. I knew how he
hated it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jack, wouldn't kill you to rub elbows now and then with
an actual capitalist. Don't worry. There won't be any photos to sully your
reputation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I suggested the place partly to pay my respects to a wounded
ward after the day's carnage and partly for Jack's convenience. It was a
combined press hangout and &quot;new money&quot; convocation, located just
around the corner from his </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New
  York</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> office in one of
those old mansions right off Fifth, midtown. They'd just begun allowing the
fair sex to cross their hallowed doorstep (after a lawsuit), a move certain
diehards felt signaled the curtain raiser on the West's Decline. For my own
part I'd actually put up Donna for membership as pan of the test case. We
eventually established that the Centurion's unwritten membership criteria were
actually pretty simple: in addition to being white and male, you also needed to
be either rich or well-known. Being all four made you a shoo-in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A couple of us fortunate enough to have friends on the
circuit bench called in a few favors and arranged for a black, female judge to
hear the case. The proceeding was over in time for lunch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is eight okay?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Done,&quot; he said. &quot;I'll be there on the
dot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was late as usual, but I managed to pass the time. It was
enough just to sip a Perrier and observe the shell-shocked faces of golden boy
brokers presently mainlining martinis down the bar. Fortunately the place was
on the ground floor so nobody could take a dive out a high window, but the
crowd had all the insouciance of hookers working a Salvation Army convention. I
checked over the room—lots of designer suits topped off by long faces—and
wondered how many millions had been dropped that day by those present. Booze
was flowing across the mahogany bar as if there were no tomorrow. Maybe there
wasn't.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At a </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>quarter
 to nine</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> Jack O'Donnell
marched up the blue marble steps, a man in from the war front.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>O'Donnell was a big guy who looked every inch a senator,
right down to the thirty-dollar haircut and the eight-hundred-dollar suit. I
think it was his overcompensation for being Irish and being crapped on by the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Columbia</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>University</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
administration most of his days. A so-so academic, he'd blossomed as a
politician—firm handshake and steel eye—and had easily devastated the
smooth-talking Long Island party hack the big money had thrown against him. The
man was a straight shooter who believed the purpose of capitalism was to make a
bette</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> for all Americans, not merely enrich
the unscrupulous or crafty few. As a result, his Senate harangues were a
lonesome cry in the takeover/arbitrage/leveraging/executive-perk wilderness.
His contempt for overpaid investment bankers was exceeded only by his disdain
for overpaid corporate CEOs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Anyway, we settled into the leather chairs of the back room
while he ordered a medicinal Scotch, double. After his nerves stabilized a bit,
I suggested he let me give him an informal rundown of what little I knew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;High goddam time.&quot; He grimly extracted a notebook.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jack, here's the <i>mea culpa</i>. I now confess before
God and you that I've been a very uneasy point man for an outfit that calls
itself Dai Nippon, International. They have been playing a little game with
interest-rate futures and currency forwards in quantities that stagger the
mind. Thus far, however, their activity has been strictly legal and right out there
for everybody to watch. I also tried to warn anybody who would listen.
Consequently any of our financial analysts who didn't see this brouhaha coming
a mile away has been suffering a severe rectal-cranial inversion.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He snorted and pulled at his drink. &quot;Okay, since you
seem to know so much about this Dai Nippon outfit, care to clue me in on what's
down the road?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jack, I think the answer is one nobody's figured.&quot;
Then I delivered my brand-new theory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stared at me skeptically, sipping at his drink. &quot;Good
God, you've gone off the deep end, Walton. I always assumed it would happen
someday.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jack, from what I hear, none of the big Japanese
securities dealers here will even pick up their phone. What does that tell you?
They're softening us up using the weapon the market dreads the most.
Uncertainty. What better way to terrify the Street? Christ, let somebody start
a rumor the President has a toothache, and they practically have to shut down
trading.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, nobody's going to believe your crazy scenario.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Matter of
fact, I don't either. It's too wild. I'll tell you what most people are saying.
All the news shows tonight hauled out our doomsday economists, Lester Thurow
and his ilk, to declare we had this one coming. The consensus going around is
the Japanese are finally fed up hearing us bellyache about trade barriers; so
they've decided to treat us to a pointed demonstration concerning exactly who
needs who. That's all. </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> now controls </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s destiny. But since a few people
here still have the idea we won the last war, </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> just wants to make sure we get our history straightened
out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Could be, I answered. But I still thought everybody was
missing the forest for the trees. Then I went on to describe Noda's building,
his high-security computer setup. Nobody would install an elaborate
headquarters like that merely to get your attention.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He listened in uncharacteristic silence, beginning to appear
a little more convinced. &quot;Well, let's run with your cockamamie theory a
second.&quot; He rattled his ice cubes, a habit of his I always found
distracting. &quot;Say something bigger is coming up, and this is just the
pre-game warm-up. What can we do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My suggestion, that the President close down all our
financial markets immediately to keep Noda's hands off them, was not received
enthusiastically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You want me to stand up in the Senate and propose
that?&quot; His already ruddy cheeks were beginning to redden even more as he
glared around the paneled room. &quot;Matt, I'd be tarred and feathered by
every stockholder in the country.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe so, I said. But what about Noda's vast </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Third Avenue</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> nerve center? His supercomputer? The
Uzis? It had ominous portent. &quot;Tell you the truth, Jack, I'm not even sure
I should be talking to you. After what happened today, that guy scares hell out
of me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We ran through the known facts a couple of times more, not
getting any closer to agreeing on the big picture. Finally he summed up his own
fears: &quot;In my view, we weathered the October '87 crash because the Fed
still had some control over liquidity. When money started disappearing out of
the market, they just printed more. They countered deflation with inflation,
kept the dollar in balance. This time, though, we've lost all three pillars
under our financial house—stocks, bonds, and the dollar. There's nothing the
government can do to stop this one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment there was a tap on my shoulder, and I looked
up to see Eduardo, the club's recent attempt at Hispanic affirmative action,
handing me a cordless phone. Then I remembered I'd set up things downtown to
forward calls to the bar. The next sounds in my ear were the mellifluous
profanities of Dr. William Henderson.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Bill had just gotten off a plane after spending a few days
loosening up at the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Sandy
  Lane</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Barbados</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, assaulting its reserves of Sugar
Cane Brandy, and he was mad as hell. His &quot;Georgia Mafia&quot; had been
caught flat-footed. Why hadn't I warned him that the Japs had scheduled this
move? Surely I must have had an inkling. He would have shorted the market and
scored a pile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I suggested he calm down, that nobody, me included, had seen
it coming. What's more, I had a strong feeling it was all—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What the hell's next?&quot; Bill continued, oblivious.
&quot;What's Noda saying?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing here but speculation. He's probably getting his
beauty sleep at the moment. But take some of your own advice, friend, and stand
clear. I've got a feeling there's less here, and more, than meets the eye.
Don't, repeat, don't get the idea you can outguess Matsuo Noda. I think he's
pulling a number, but—&quot;     &quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Bill interjected something brief and unrepeatable and rang
off, undoubtedly headed for consolation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Was that </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>?&quot;
Jack asked, then watched me nod. Bill had pitched in to help Jack out of a few
tight spots on the money front, in appreciation of which O'Donnell had proposed
him for the Council of Economic Advisers—and shortly thereafter forfeited all
credibility with the administration. These days he couldn't have gotten into
the White House on a VFW tour. &quot;Well, the man's got no idea when to keep
his mouth shut with the press, but he's nobody's idea of a fool. What does he
think this is all about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sounds like he's just studying the tea leaves like
everybody else.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jack sighed, then rattled his cubes some more. &quot;Well, if
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> can't figure out what's going on,
then nobody can. That in itself ought to tell us there's a patch of slippery
ice down the road. My own guess is the Japanese have decided to play a little
poker with the American markets without having the damnedest idea of the
consequences.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jack, what if they <i>do</i>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>After we sat there gazing at the gilded plasterwork
ceiling for a while, we started getting caught up on old times. He inquired
what I thought the press would do to him if he married one of his staffers. My
guess was that a photo of Washington's most eligible divorce veteran at the
altar once more would probably make the cover of People. Everybody loves a
lover. That possibility seemed to cheer him up a bit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was round about then, probably close to ten-thirty P.M.,
that another call came through. This time I already had a feeling who it was,
and I momentarily considered not taking it. But then, why not let O'Donnell
have the story straight from the source.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The caller was, of course, Matsuo Noda. It must have been
late morning, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> time, after a very long night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What, he inquired, was my on-the-spot reading of the scene?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know.&quot; The phone had that same funny whine
I remembered, as though he had a private phone system worldwide. &quot;Maybe
you should be telling me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda-san, no surprise, didn't seem particularly unsettled by
the developments.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I assure you there is no cause for alarm, Mr. Walton.
The situation may seem temporarily unfortunate, but I have long believed all
things turn out for the best.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Could have fooled me. But while we're all waiting for the
silver lining to this cloud, you could do everybody a favor and get your goddam
securities dealers here to issue a statement clarifying their intentions.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton&quot;-—he chuckled—&quot;you ascribe far too
much influence to me. I am merely a banker, one of many in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. I have no control over what our institutions choose
to do or not do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I wish I could believe that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I suppose there are many things about Dai Nippon
that need to be explained more fully. I look forward to seeing you next week.
We can talk then.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Upon which he advised me just to sit tight. All further
communications would be routed through their office uptown. And with that
dictum in place, he suddenly had better things to do and said thanks for all my
help. There was the sound of some satellite bleeps, then silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Welcome to the Brave New World, I thought. Again I had this
definite feeling the DNI rodeo had just begun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By then Jack was nearing terminal exhaustion. I passed along
Noda's cryptic refusal to lift a hand, advised him to make a statement tomorrow
that the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> financial markets could be dangerous
to everybody's health, and helped him into a cab for his aide's place uptown.
The evening was fizzling out with nobody left at the bar but regulars. Thus I
went home alone to check in with Amy and then drift off into a very unsettling
dream.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Funny thing about investor confidence: often as not it relies
more on faith than facts. Give it a little unsettling heat, and it can just
melt away. Belief turns to fear, then blind panic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Insight number two: the bigger you are, the more scared you
tend to get. So what appeared to be a sudden Japanese loss of conviction
regarding the U.S. Treasury's ability to meet its standing obligations received
close attention from the world's bankers, from </span><span style='font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

Treasury's thirty-year issue had scooted up four full interest points. There
was still a market for Uncle Sam's IOUs—everything on this planet will move for
a price—but buyers were wary. They wanted their newly perceived risk sweetened
considerably.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Predictably rates on corporate and municipal bonds did a
similar tango north, leaving </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s conservative investors wondering
what hit them. In fact, a lot of scheduled corporate debt offerings were
scuttled to await more settled times and lower rates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The dollar also stayed on the critical list. Everybody was
worried the U.S. Treasury might just rev up the printing presses to produce
enough greenbacks to pay off all the foreigners who wanted their money back.
Since Paul &quot;tight money&quot; Volcker—who probably would have thrown his
robust torso onto the ink to prevent that from happening—was now gone, there
was nobody at the Fed with a real commitment to holding back the flood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And the stock market. People weren't starting to call this
Black November for nothing. A lot of players feared that the higher rates would
hobble the economy, a perfect excuse to head for the exits while the getting
was good. As </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> liked to observe: psychology is a
fundamental too. The next day the Dow sank another two hundred points; the day
after that a hundred more. (Where had those sellers been two days before?) The
fourth and fifth days it slowed, heaved an audible sigh of exhaustion, and sort
of peered up out of the bunker to see if the bombing runs had let up. The
downward pressure was still evident, but it was finally losing some of its
steam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yours truly did a lot of thinking as the week wore on, while
the country appeared to wobble on the brink of unprecedented disaster. I also
conferred now and then with Jack O'Donnell and with </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> in between their appearances on TV
chat shows. Although Bill's bearish reading of the nation's estate had been
vindicated well beyond what even he had envisioned, I can report he took small
pleasure in his newfound celebrity; he was increasingly miserable over his own
missed opportunities in the financial casino. Jack, for his part, had gained a
profound appreciation of the helplessness of government to intervene when fear
and greed seize the marketplace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My personal ruminations on the situation turned out to be too
Machiavellian for anybody to entertain seriously. Question: If you wanted to
pull all your money out of the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, is this how you'd do it? Answer: No
way. Instead you'd go about it gradually, a little at a time, in order not to
stampede the markets and cause exactly what was happening now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ergo, I concluded, this isn't real. Noda just wants every</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>investor in
the world to assume there's a Japanese pullout underway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But why the grandstand play? Sure, he'd made a pile, but he
didn't seem like a guy who had to sweat his mortgage payments. Nor did this
kind of market manipulation require a building in midtown </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Manhattan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and a computer setup to rival NORAD
headquarters. Something more had to be coming. And the only thing I could think
of was that Noda's something had a lot to do with my profession.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was not a welcome piece of prognostication to loose upon
the world. Since the financial markets already had plenty of problems on their
plate, there wasn't all that much interest in speculating about the next
course. Consequently nobody made the slightest attempt to man the ramparts for
what was ahead. Our financial battleship had been stopped dead in the water and
its engines disabled, but nobody was even bothering to prime the guns. This
couldn't be an all-out attack. Right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Wrong. The stage was now set for Noda's real move. The
following Saturday I was summoned to Dai Nippon's midtown fortress where I
watched my crazy theory become reality. Before anybody in our shell-shocked
financial centers had time to digest what had happened, Matsuo Noda—his Dai
Nippon Eight-Hundred-Year funds underwritten through a syndicate of Japanese
banks and insurance companies led by the Dai-Ichi Credit Corporation, Ltd. of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>—hit the beach.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the days to come I did manage to assemble a rough outline
of how Noda pulled off his brilliant opening feint. It was elegant, and to
savor it fully requires a quick peek at his reserves—</span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s bankbook.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Start with personal savings, the hundreds of billions being
squirreled away by individual Japanese. Then add to those monies the assets of
Japanese pension funds, private savings organizations with several hundred
billion dollars to lend out. Next come insurance companies and corporations,
similarly awash in loose cash. Taken together, the total amount of excess
capital in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> is now well over five trillion
dollars.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If all those zeros befuddle you as much as they do me, try
thinking of it like this: a trillion dollars is the size of the annual </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> budget. So if the Japanese regulators opened the
floodgates and let all that money roll, its citizens have the ready bucks to
finance our government's entire budget—Lockheed, stockpiles, and pork
barrel—for at least five years using just what's in their mattresses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As it happens, all this Japanese cash has become an
important, nay, indispensable, component of the American financial scene. We
and the Japanese are like an old married couple: they're the wife who scrimps
and saves, we're the husband who borrows and squanders. The middlemen who rifle
her purse and ship the proceeds to us are, increasingly, Japanese investment
firms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At least half a dozen major Japanese securities dealers with
offices in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> run big bond departments. The
foremost of these is, of course, Nomura Securities International, the world's
largest brokerage house (having aced out Merrill Lynch). With over two hundred
billion dollars in customer accounts, Nomura is now a primary dealer in U.S.
Treasury issues, meaning they can buy directly from the government and sell to their
clients. And since Treasuries pay several interest points better in return than
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s miserly savings accounts, their
customers back home think they're getting a terrific deal. Little wonder
Japanese investors finance a full third of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s
budget overdrafts these days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Another major player is Daiwa Securities America, which also
underwrites federal paper on its own. Nor should we overlook Nikko Securities
and Yamaichi Securities, both handling money in the tens of billions. These
outfits and others are well past the beachhead stage of entry into the world
capital markets. They're entrenched; they're big; and they know how to play
hardball. Were they involved in Noda's assault? Nobody ever knew for sure. But
you figure it out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Banks. As it happens, the biggest one in the world is
Japanese. The Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Ltd. of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
has unceremoniously reduced Citicorp to second banana. Rounding out the top
five worldwide are </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Fuji</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, Sumitomo, and Mitsubishi. And
worldwide means everywhere. </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> controls ten percent of the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> banking business, a quarter of all British banking.
Of the ten largest banks in the sovereign state of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>California</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, four are Japanese. </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> in brief has become banker to the world, with more
ready money than anybody else, and it also has a battalion of financial samurai
who know the game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What makes these Japanese players especially powerful is the
kind of bucks they represent. It's called hot money—cash lent out short-term
and therefore subject to immediate withdrawal. Instead of tying up their
overseas bankroll for years, they stick to offshore investments that can be
called in tomorrow. At home </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> invests for the long horizon, but
abroad the bulk of the money is short. Hot money.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since foreign investors normally pick up well over half of a
given Treasury refunding, the paralysis when </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> began recalling its hot money, thereby spooking buyers
worldwide, was as predictable as the sunrise. Matsuo Noda didn't have to be a
Rhodes Scholar to realize how much mileage there'd be in a big Japanese
sell-off program and a &quot;no comment&quot; from his dealers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Here's how he orchestrated the details. Apparently it had all
been very Japanese, very consensus. A few phone calls, then a lot of meetings
over green tea. Later on, some late nights with sake. Noda, thanks to his new
clout, had been in the driver's seat from the start. The money managers in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> were all feeling the heat over demands by investors
that they participate in the multiple Eight-Hundred-Year funds he'd floated.
All across </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> people were starting to ask whether
their savings were out there waving the flag too. A lot of those managers were
starting to get edgy, so Noda thoughtfully struck a deal, a little consensus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, hold your monies, but let's get organized. When the
next Treasury collection plate comes by, don't roll over any more short-term </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> T-bills and don't take a piece of the next sale of
long bonds. In fact, that's the day you begin to divest. Staggering losses? No
problem. I just happen to have everybody's portfolio insulated with futures
contracts. Sell away, and even when the price plummets, nobody's gonna lose a
yen. In fact, you can have a piece of the currency windfall I've set up.
Apparently everybody shook hands on it, or whatever they do in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> nowadays.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Consequently none of the big Japanese houses in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> had to take a lot of risk. The
sellers were covered by Noda's rate contracts, which I later discovered he'd
passed along (at cost) to anybody who needed them. The rest he sold himself for
a hefty profit. So in the course of his play, he incidentally raised several
billions in additional operating capital for Dai Nippon while fully protecting
the home team.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When the dust had finally settled, it turned out he didn't
actually liquidate very much Treasury paper after all. He didn't need to. In
fact </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> dumped only about eight percent of
its</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>holdings. If
you think about it a minute you realize they couldn't possibly have hoped to
divest everything they had in dollars. What would they do with all that cash?
Loan it to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Brazil</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Veterans of world finance will tell you there were already
precedents for this kind of Japanese muscle. Back in the mid- eighties, Nomura
Securities had unsheathed its financial sword and totally controlled the
Eurobond markets for about a fortnight. They were just letting everybody know
they were in town. So there was nothing particularly unprecedented about a
little number whereby a handful of Japanese banks and securities firms could,
by concerted action, bring the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> financial system to its knees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Although I'd been convinced from the very first that Matsuo
Noda had engineered the whole move, I had no hard proof. Besides, what was I
supposed to do? No laws were broken. He was playing strictly by the rules. So I
just took cover like everybody else and watched the marketplace disintegrate.
My main preoccupation was a growing suspicion that Noda was now moving up his
battery of guns for the next round of shelling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was right. His Treasury sell-off had merely been a
demonstration of firepower. Its effectiveness must have given confidence that
his beachhead was secured, since he came ashore at the end of the week to take
personal command of the real landing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He and his general staff hit town quietly and with no fanfare
on Thursday, spent Friday in a strategy session, and on Saturday took over the
computerized command HQ on </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Third
  Avenue</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. That afternoon
Tanaka called and ordered me (very politely but curtly) to assemble my records
and come uptown. The operation was being consolidated and Noda-san wanted me
coordinated. From now on I would be working out of their offices.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was it. Just what I'd been waiting for. At last I could
confront the bastard, one-on-one. No way was I going to be part of the big
assault I saw directly ahead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My first look at the revised operation uptown confirmed my
worst fears. The technical analysts had been replaced by a new set of troops:
money men. Open collars were gone, supplanted by a lot of business-school types
wearing thin black ties. Tanaka's office had been moved off to the side; the
corner office now belonged to Dai Nippon's four-star commanding general: Matsuo
Noda. After I'd cleared security, that's where I was led.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton, how good to see you again.&quot; He looked
up from a printout, his silver hair perfectly groomed. &quot;I do hope today is
convenient for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is going to be brief.&quot; I ignored the chair he
rose to adjust for me. &quot;I'm only here to advise you that my participation
is officially terminated as of this moment. I'll be sending you a final invoice
next week. You can find yourself another attorney.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But your work has scarcely begun.&quot; He appeared to
be mildly puzzled, as though I'd just made a small misstatement about the
weather or some such. &quot;We expect your participation to be crucial.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Surely you're joking.&quot; I was turning to leave.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton.&quot; He shifted the printout around and
shoved it across the desk. &quot;Contrary to what you may presume, we are here
to help this country. You might wish to look over our program for the near
term.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This I've got to see.&quot; I came back and studied it
for a few seconds . . . then stared back at him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Impossible.&quot; I finally realized he was serious.
&quot;Whatever you're thinking, I'll tell you right now you don't have a
chance. These outfits have lawyers. Hundreds of them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah, but that's why you are on our staff. This is your
specialty.&quot; He smiled. &quot;Remember the Book of Five Rings by the
swordsman Miyamoto Musashi? In it he describes the three kinds of attack. There
is the Ken no Sen, where you move first and catch your opponent unprepared;
next is the Tai no Sen, whereby your initial move occurs a split second after
your opponent's; and finally there is the Taitai no Sen, in which you and he
attack at the same instant. What has happened up until today might be likened
to the Ken no Sen. We have made sure that nothing was anticipated. Very soon,
however, we will have to move to the Tai no Sen, responding with lightning
speed to the moves of those who would thwart us. Miyamoto Musashi declared
correctly that if you are attacked with force, you must counterattack with even
greater force and thereby upset momentarily your opponent's rhythm. That moment
can mean victory, but only if you are totally prepared.&quot; He leaned back.
&quot;We must be totally prepared.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why in hell would I want to help you? I guess you
didn't hear me. I've just resigned.&quot; I turned for the door. &quot;Besides,
nobody could pull off what you're planning. You're going to have battalions of
attorneys moving against you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I expect that.&quot; He stopped smiling. &quot;But that
area is your responsibility now, Mr. Walton. A good swordsman does not think,
he acts. Intuitively.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And if I refuse?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You cannot possibly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Try me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Only you can handle this, Mr. Walton. Betray us, and
you may well witness the disappearance of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
as an industrial nation. The time is now or never.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That zinger gave me pause. He meant it. But before I had a
chance to tell him he was completely crazy, he went on to sketch out what he
claimed was his objective. How he planned to address the American
&quot;crisis&quot; and resolve it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Let me tell you my first impression of Matsuo Noda's
scenario. It was legal, it was legit, and it was—as Joanna's teenage niece used
to describe notable phenomena—totally fucking awesome.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What's more, he wanted me to stay on as tail-gunner. The
truth? I felt the disorientation of a kid who'd been fooling around in the Soap
Box Derby suddenly being handed a slot in the </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Indianapolis</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> 500.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The most astonishing part of all was, I had the feeling he
just might pull it off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>You're right. I should have said no, not on your life, this
is way out of my league, never in a million years. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Instead I said I'd think about it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good, he said. Why didn't I stick around till Monday and get
a feeling for the operation?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I didn't shake his hand. I just walked out and poured myself
a cup of green tea from the huge urn there in the middle of the floor. Walton,
you idiot, how did you get yourself into this?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which is when I spotted a sporty looking lady way across on
the other side of the floor, over by the climate-controlled NEC mainframe.
Something about her seemed vaguely familiar. Definitely not DNI staff. Wearing
jeans, dark hair in a nice designer cut, handled herself like a mover. Not to
mention a world-class bottom inside those tight, shapely Calvins. From all
appearances she actually seemed to be second-in-command. She was reading the
riot act to Tanaka about something to do with the computer, had the
self-important little fucker bobbing and weaving. Who was that? Hadn't seen her
around here before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, now, no time like the present to head on over and check
into this. A fellow <i>gaijin</i>. Could be she'll explain what in hell's going
on. Is Noda real?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Suddenly she turned around, saw me, and stopped. I stopped.
We both just stood there trying to remember. She hit pay dirt first, but I was
only microseconds behind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Want to know my first thought, my very first thought? Matsuo
Noda, you son of a bitch, you're even smarter than I'd given you credit for.
You've hired the best, the very best.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is this how you pick up your women these days, Matt?
Given up on vegetable stands?&quot; She was walking toward me wearing a smile.
I tried to grin back. &quot;How are you, Matthew? Good to see you've still got
your hair. Well, most of it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Richardson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, I don't believe this. Now I know it
all is a dream. Please tell me you were kidnapped. None of this is really
happening, right? It's just a very big, very bad dream. We'll all wake up
tomorrow and go to the beach.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Welcome aboard, partner.&quot; She stuck out her hand.
&quot;It's going to be a wild trip.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No kidding.&quot; I looked her over as I took her hand.
Nice and warm. Time had treated her well. Very well. &quot;How long have you
known Noda?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Less than a month.&quot; She was checking me over too.
Wonder how I was doing. &quot;How long have you been helping him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It occurred to me that we both should have been using that
classic hooker response when the guy asks his young companion how long she's
been in her particular field of endeavor and she replies, &quot;Long enough to
know better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Few months now. Noda is pretty impressive.&quot; I
tried to sound casual. &quot;Not to mention persuasive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That he is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, let's have a toast to winning this.&quot; I
turned to the urn. &quot;How about some tea, Professor?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Love it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, let's just hope these guys don't suddenly decide
to eat us alive.&quot; I passed it over. &quot;What do you think our chances of
survival are?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That one startled her. I got the impression she was half
thinking the same thing. Then she managed a thin laugh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'll eat them first if they try.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You still talk tough. I always told you you should have
been a lawyer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But she was right. Once the cards are dealt, you play to win.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which is exactly what I planned to do. Since my own part was
still down the road, that weekend I just sat in their offices watching spellbound
as Noda and Dr. Tamara Richardson reviewed the data and put together the
financial details. Next, a lot of coded telexes were sent out to pile up
somewhere in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> with instructions for routing of the
funds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After I'd digested his opening move, I did have occasion to
ask the boss a few pointed questions. Such as, wasn't he at all nervous that
Wall Street might rebound before he could get rolling? He replied, correctly as
usual, that the total collapse in the financial markets would last for a while.
Even though the dollar was still down for the count (over forty percent), he
figured only the most intrepid foreign speculators would go plunging into the
American stock market looking for bargains. As for American investors, most of
them, including the institutions, were still in shock. He rightly forecast that
the herd mentality of the Street hadn't been repealed. War stories of '87 were
going around and nobody wanted to make the textbooks as a fool. Better a little
profit forgone than more money lost. The mutual fund managers, most of whom had
been caught with their pants at half-mast, were devoting their energies that
weekend to composing creative explanations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Events Monday proved him to be essentially on target. There
was an eerie quiet over the financial landscape. Everybody was waiting for
somebody else to try breathing life back into the corpse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then a few analysts noticed something peculiar. Anonymous buy
orders were coming in, more and more, for stocks in the sector hardest hit,
high tech. Maybe it was bargain hunters, but the buyers weren't any of the
&quot;growth&quot; mutual funds that might have been expected to lead the
action. In fact, many of those hotshot managers were relieved to part with some
of the dogs they'd ridden down that long, lonesome decline of the week before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Gradually the prices of certain securities began to edge up</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>in this
early thin trading, enticing more and more holders to &quot;sell on
strength.&quot; What issues? First off, anything to do with computers. Of
course there weren't all that many hardware manufacturers left around by then,
after the shakeout and mergers of the mid-eighties, but somebody was buying
heavily into the few that remained. They were also actively purchasing little
software outfits. Those stocks had taken a heavy beating over the past week, so
prices were at an all-time low for most.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Other industries they started to nibble at were
telecommunications, aerospace, biotechnology. They seemed to be looking for
outfits with substantial R&amp;D operations: the focus was on creativity,
growth sectors, the sunrise industries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Of course, what this mysterious new buyer was really doing
was snapping up outfits loaded with labs and Ph.D.'s. Dr. Richardson and my new
client Matsuo Noda had DNI acquiring companies short on competent management
and market share but long on research, innovation—the one thing we were still
halfway good at. Looked at differently, what Dai Nippon was really buying was
underused brainpower, the American smarts currently going to waste thanks to
inept corporate management.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Explanations began to sprout all over the place—from the
&quot;Heard on the Street&quot; column in the Journal to Dan Dorfman, a guy
with a bloodhound's nose for Wall Street shenanigans. But the hard truth was
nobody could put it together. Who could have? The play was too ambitious even
to imagine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>You guessed it. With the trillions and trillions now at its
disposal, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> was about to take charge of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s future.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:1.0pt;color:windowtext'><img

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The task ahead can be described very simply. I was going to
help Dai Nippon acquire controlling stock positions in a bevy of ineptly
managed American high-tech companies, and she was going to be in charge of
turning them around. I was DNI's takeover artist; Tam was the fix-it expert.
That probably sounds a bit ambitious on everybody's part, but after watching
the Dai Nippon juggernaut for a couple of days I knew one thing for sure: we'd
have plenty of heavy backup.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why did I agree to ride shotgun for Matsuo Noda's &quot;Save
America&quot; project? Because, if he meant what he said, such a program was
long overdue. American industry was in trouble, and it was hurting a lot of
good, hardworking people who didn't deserve to be hurt. Worse still, this
wasn't some random act of God. It was largely the result of self-serving
corporate management. Most occupiers of the executive suites these days were
too busy merging and acquiring and leveraging to do what stockholders thought
they were paying them for: building industry and creating American jobs. (Well,
maybe that's an overstatement; they had kept Drexel Burnham's junk-bond cowboys
working overtime.) In the mid-eighties, American corporations were spending two
and three times more on mergers and acquisitions than on research and
development. Most industrialists here no longer cared to try making anything as
old-fashioned as competitive products; they preferred to make deals and sell
imports. The net result was that </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
the world's major economic locomotive, was veering off the track and seriously
in danger of taking everybody else in the world along with it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's where Matsuo Noda came in. Part of the arrangement
he'd made with the Japanese institutions putting up the funds was that he would
be given proxy to exercise all voting rights. Face it, he had a pretty
impressive performance record overseeing the long-range planning and investment
of well-run corporations. So after I'd helped Dai Nippon acquire control of a
long list of poorly managed companies, he and Tam Richardson were planning to
move in, clear out the deadwood, and lay down priorities for restructuring. She
was Dai Nippon's technical director for all U.S. operations, which meant she
was going to head up the team on the newly evacuated floor just above the
financial section—Noda's management samurai.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Enough theory. Here's how it actually went. On Friday the
story was finally broken by The Wall Street Journal, a little squib in
&quot;What's News,&quot; with a short two-column analysis on page 3. The piece
revealed that all the heavy new activity building in the high-tech sector of
the market represented buys being coordinated by a new Japanese investment
concern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This sudden, unexpected program of foreign investment was
heralded at first as a salubrious omen, refuting those doomsayers who were
claiming the world had lost confidence in the </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
In fact, if anything it was proof that overseas enthusiasm was actually
increasing. </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s previous practice of focusing on
debt instruments was at best passive investment. But buying heavily into a
sector of the economy that appeared weak was something else entirely. It was a
rousing endorsement of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s prospects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>To be fair, there was still a modest case to be made in that
direction. Our high-tech sector wasn't all struggling high fliers operating out
of some one-story cinder block on Route 128 or the Washington Beltway. </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> had plenty of solid industry in high
tech—computers, aerospace, office machinery—and American laboratories and
universities were the envy of the world. The problem lay with the downside.
We'd lost our lead in electronics, drugs, scientific instruments, plastics,
communications equipment . . . it's a long list. In fact, </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s overall trade balance in high-tech
products had actually gone negative, shrunk from a twenty-five billion dollar
surplus as recently as 1980. The ignored question, therefore: Given the
direction things were headed, why were the Japanese suddenly supposed to be so
impressed?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The market's initial euphoria didn't last long however. By
the end of the second week the SEC was sniffing the air and the lunch talk
downtown, from the AMEX traders at Harry's to the expense-account crowd at
historic Fraunces Tavern, was</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>focused on
what appeared to be a major shift in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s
investment strategy. Now that the stock market was in shambles, they weren't just
dabbling anymore; they were cashing in on the fire sale hand over fist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thus the Street's early cheering melted into apprehension. </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> had already taken apart our debt and currency
markets, turned them upside down, and scored a bundle. Now Noda had Wall Street
looking over its shoulder and reminiscing about the good old days when all it
had to worry about was rich, crazy Arabs. When it became clear that Dai Nippon
was assaulting the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> securities markets with high-speed
computers and a checkbook that just kept coming, there weren't all that many
wisecracks about camels and tents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Wall Street, however, merely counts; it doesn't think. The
real disquiet was reserved for corporate boardrooms. Take it as a given that
when the Securities and Exchange Commission reports some ten, twenty, or thirty
percent of your company's stock has just been swallowed by a cash-rich Japanese
raider, your attention can focus most exquisitely. In a word, Matsuo Noda was
the talk of industrial </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. More to the point, and exactly what
he had expected, the boards and CEOs of the companies being bought were
beginning to be scared shitless. A major player with seemingly bottomless
pockets was gobbling up heavy blocks of their publicly traded shares. Worse
still, nobody had the slightest inkling why.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What all those entrenched CEOs didn't realize, in their
wildest paranoia, was that seven-figure salaries and cushy executive perks were
about to go the way of Cadillac tail fins. World competition, not executive
compensation, would be the new game. Playtime was over; </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> was about to get serious again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My early suspicions concerning my role in Noda's design had
been precisely on the mark. I was indeed the freelance gunslinger he wanted by
his side when the companies he was aiming at started to shoot back, which they
surely would. Needless to say, if his plan was ever allowed to reach the
courts, it would create a virtual &quot;living trust&quot; for half the
corporate lawyers in the land. He'd be in litigation through the twenty-first
century as managements fought to the last stockholder's dollar to keep their
jobs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Enter Matt Walton. Time for some samurai-style legal
swordsmanship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The rules: If you're CEO of a company and somebody starts
buying up a major chunk of your stock with the intent of taking you over,
you've got roughly four basic ways to stop him. The first is to try and bribe
that buyer to go away, paying him a ransom—politely called greenmail—to sell
his holdings and disappear. (More than one corporate raider you've read about in
the papers has made millions in a couple of weeks using that very play.) The
drawbacks of trying to buy off a potential acquirer are, (1) it's expensive,
and (2) maybe he really does plan to eat you, in which case it won't work
anyway. Matsuo Noda was in that category.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A second popular means to thwart a hostile takeover is to go
out and find somebody else to buy you first, the proverbial &quot;white
knight.&quot; Ideally this friendly buyer should be, (1) too big to be taken
over himself, and (2) willing to let you keep your playpen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A third technique to stop somebody from acquiring a
controlling chunk of your stock is to jack up the price, usually by offering to
buy it yourself. Float some junk bonds, sell off a few divisions, do anything
that will raise cash and then offer the shareholders more than the raider is
willing to bid. This can be very expensive, but if you're a CEO with millions
in compensation every year, why should you care if your stockholders' company
is leveraged to the brink of ruin? You've still got your job and your goodies.
It's used a lot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The fourth and most fashionable way these days to stop
hostile mergers is to try and make yourself unmergeable. To do that, you get
your board of directors to vote a poison pill. What this does is make sure that
any company that swallows you is going to be ingesting a piranha that will eat
said company's own guts instead. The newest twist on this is to use phony bonds
with a so-called flip-over provision, a killer pill invented by a clever </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> law operation I won't name but whose
initials might be WLR&amp;K. Their game is as follows. In order to protect
yourself you invent some convertible bonds and stash them away somewhere,
ready. Then, should a raiding company start acquiring your stock or make an
unauthorized tender offer to your shareholders, you hand out these little bombs
to everybody who owns your shares. If this unfriendly company is then unlucky
enough to actually acquire you, those convertibles &quot;flip over&quot; into
the stock of that buyer. Your stockholders suddenly have the right to exchange
their funny paper for huge, discounted chunks of real stock in the acquiring
company—which would, naturally, be ruined should that happen. And usually, just
for good measure, you also vote through a few &quot;golden parachutes&quot; for
you and all your cronies, giving everybody in the executive suite severance pay
in the tens of millions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Those were the stakes. Now, a lot of outfits suddenly found
themselves being bought by a mysterious Japanese entity named Dai Nippon,
International. What were they going to do? At first of course everybody just
assumed NDI was merely angling for a little greenmail. No such luck. After a
couple of days went by and we hadn't returned anybody's phone call, they knew
that wasn't it. Next, a few went looking for a white knight with more money
than DNI (a tough assignment). Not surprisingly, however, most corporate
managers very quickly decided to call a board meeting and ram through a poison
pill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I got more than a few phone calls at my downtown office from
CEOs wanting to know if I could pitch in and help them stave off what looked
like an unfriendly Japanese buy-up. I had to say, sorry fellows, I'm
unavailable. But why not give it your best shot and try the old
&quot;pill&quot;?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Most of them did. They had no option really.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which suited me fine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The time was late Friday—the afternoon was gorgeous, sunny
and crisp—and the place was Noda's office. Naturally he understood all about
poison pills, so he knew the problem. What he wanted to hear was our solution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd like to try something that's never been done
before. A different battle plan.&quot; I glanced out at the blue sky and wished
I was already in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>St.
 Croix</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> on holiday with
Amy. &quot;However, I think it's possibly just unconventional enough to
fly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It has to be legal, Mr. Walton.&quot; Noda leaned back
in his chair, waiting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is. But in order to lay the groundwork, we'll first
need to set up a string of dummy corporations.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Any particular state?&quot; He was listening closely
now, his mind clicking away. I was never sure what the man was thinking, but I
figured he'd probably seen it all before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That old standby </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Delaware</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>

tax-haven places, if only because the paperwork is minimal. In the </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm familiar with world geography, Mr. Walton.&quot; He
was deadpan. A joke?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

have no assets.&quot;</span></p>

no problem. Please proceed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;While those corporations are being set up, you continue
buying stock in whatever companies you need to control, making sure in all
cases that you acquire just enough to deliberately trigger their poison-pill
mechanism. We force them to issue their flip-over bonds. They can't stop the
process, since it's always set up to be automatic after a certain percentage of
stock has been acquired. Not even the boards of directors can revoke it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, Mr. Walton. I'm aware of that.&quot; He didn't
seem the slightest bit ruffled by my unorthodox opener.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, let me elaborate. The reason we want to trigger
their poison pill first is so that nobody can later come in as a white knight
and save them. They're totally isolated. They'll have made themselves into
sitting ducks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very good.&quot; He leaned back. Was he really that far
ahead of me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;While that's happening, you 'sell' the stock acquired
thus far to one of the dummy outfits we've set up, in return for debt paper.
Which puts DNl at arm's length and untouchable. After that, you lend that dummy
corporation the rest of the millions or billions necessary to acquire a
controlling interest in the company, taking back as collateral more junk bonds
at absurdly usurious rates. That makes it a financial leper, but you don't care:
you're merely lending yourself the money. This paper corporation is all that
can be touched when the acquired company's poison bonds flip over. So instead
of being convertible into the stock of some cash-rich corporation, the way they
were intended, those flip-bonds are going to give their holders a piece of some
offshore phone booth with zero assets and enough debt to choke a horse. They're
worthless paper. And you're in the clear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He smiled. &quot;Which means our program can proceed on
schedule?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dai Nippon will be totally insulated from their poison
pills. Like the guy who sells his house and boat to his company and then lets
it file Chapter 11 bankruptcy in order to protect his personal assets from
creditors. Nobody can lay a glove on you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton&quot;—he leaned back, a twinkle in his dark
eyes—&quot;that's exactly why I knew you were right for us. You have an
intuitive grasp of tactics.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you do this, there're going to be a lot of unhappy,
unemployed lawyers in this town.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Most regrettable. Some of them might even have to go
out and find productive work.&quot; He rose and shook my hand. &quot;You've
destroyed the prospect of years of legal roadblocks in a single stroke. It's
elegant.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was. Sun Tzu and Miyamoto Musashi would definitely have
approved. But there still had to be more. An unexpected opening is not enough
in itself; it needs an equally deft follow-up. Bushido, the Way of the Sword,
teaches that you should first surprise your antagonist, and then you must
confound him. Both the initial attack and the carry-through are crucial to
success. Among other things, that meant Noda's mechanism for calling a board
meeting of the companies he'd be acquiring had to be instantaneous, without the
usual niceties.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This setup should do the job, but only if it's used with
finesse. Otherwise the whole system gets buried in paperwork.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You have to be fast, and flexible. Once you've taken
ownership of a company, you've got to gain immediate control over its board of
directors, in order to block any and all countermoves.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I understand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you? I'm talking about the ability to call an
executive session out of the blue. The <i>kesa</i> stroke of the sword. The
power to cut a CEO in half before he can blink. No time for consensus and the
usual Japanese niceties.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stood quietly, thinking. At last he spoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In other words, I must be able to convene the board at
a moment's notice. Is that the essence of what you are saying?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing else is going to work.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very well. After we have a commanding stock position,
we can institute the necessary changes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good. Remember though, that's still merely half the
battle. Besides being able to call board meetings, you need full authority to
institute a shareholders' vote, which in this case will consist of nothing more
than you signing your name.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perfectly reasonable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is. But it also means you've got to be available to
me at all times. Can I rely on that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned and strolled to the window, pensively. &quot;That
may not always be possible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then you've got a potential problem.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He revolved back and studied me a second, finally taking the
bait. &quot;There is, of course, one very simple solution. I can merely assign
you power of attorney, allowing you to act in my name if I cannot be
reached.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That would do it. But you'd be handing over a lot of
authority.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I envision no difficulty.&quot; He looked me over with
the self- assurance of a tiger contemplating a haunch of beef. &quot;I have
every reason to believe you would always act in DNI's best interest, Mr.
Walton.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was possible he knew a few things I didn't. On the other
hand, maybe Matsuo Noda had just overreached, taken too much for granted.
Whichever it was, the maneuvering just completed had been one small step for
Tam, and Matthew Walton. Should we ever need them, I'd just conned Matsuo Noda
into giving me duplicates of the keys to his Kingdom. It was our protection
and, in a way, my secret price for putting our heads into Dai Nippon's noose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then it looks like we have everything we need to move
forward.&quot; I nodded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Excellent.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Upon which I absented his office, safety net in place. The
play was on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which brings us to Tam Richardson. If my approach to this new
job was a little unconventional, what about the college prof who showed up in
jeans as she readied to renovate corporate </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>?
One thing, we suited each other. It was a tag team made in heaven. After I'd
pried open the door to the companies DNI was buying, she was going to roll in,
guns blazing, and shove everybody against the wall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Let me add one important distinction, however. Whereas I may
have been wary, even slightly skeptical, Tam was definitely the idealist. She
was, by God, going to get this country moving again. </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> was once more going to lead, she
declared, not follow. No defensive Fortress </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
claptrap. Hers would be nothing less than a full-scale assault, intended to win
back and keep a solid manufacturing base here, toe-to-toe with the world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since no overall American program existed to rescue
industries now being killed by foreign competition, she was going to do it
herself, create a coordinated battle plan for our strategic sectors. Backed by
Noda's Japanese billions, she was about to try and redeem this country's
future, leading us back to number one. She also was quick to add she had no
intention of merely copying </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s famous management techniques.
Japanese industry, she insisted, hadn't invented long-term planning, sound
capital investment, dedication. What they did over there these days was what
the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> used to do. The American work ethic
was alive and well; it was just temporarily on the wrong side of the globe. She
was about to bring it home again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe she could. One major impediment at least would be out
of the way. Since the companies Dai Nippon was taking over would no longer have
to answer to a lot of fickle fund managers every three months, they could start
investing for the longer term. Also a lot of unnecessary fat was going to be
sliced out of upper management. If things went as planned, Dr. Tamara
Richardson and Dai Nippon were about to become the ruthless architects of a new
corporate </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Unless . . . well, there seemed no reason not to take things
at face value, at least for now. DNI's new Industrial Management Section on the
twelfth floor had already begun filling up with young </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span style='font-size:
 10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>University</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> graduates, guys who embodied the
work ethic in human guise. They meant business. Nobody was sipping coffee and
critiquing last night's rerun of Dynasty. I got the definite impression one of
the unsmiling whiz kids in Noda's handpicked cadre could chew up about five
American MBAs for breakfast. Tam currently had them working overtime, putting
together a reorganization plan for an outfit in </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Boston</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>, one of their new acquisitions, which I guess I'd better
just call XYZ. The previous week Dai Nippon had purchased some twenty-four
percent of its stock, presently at a historic low, and she was planning to make
the company her showcase turnaround.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stock in hand, she'd buckled down with her new staff and
using DNI's analytical machinery confirmed some alarming suspicions. It turned
out XYZ was practically a terminal case, living at the moment off its real
estate assets, which were being systematically dribbled away to mask heavy
losses. Layoffs would be next.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By Thursday of the second week, however, she'd put together a
restructuring, including some painful austerity that might just salvage the
company and its American jobs. She went home that night feeling quite proud of
herself, and Friday she flew up to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Boston</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
for her first official conference with XYZ's chief executive officer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since a quarter of a company's shares gives the holder
reasonably high recognition, the CEO was understandably nervous about who
exactly had acquired a fourth of his company inside of a week and a half. He
appeared at </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Logan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> with his Rolls limo to receive Dr.
Richardson personally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She explained right off that she was there merely to pass
along a few of DNI's &quot;recommendations.&quot; She took one look at the
Rolls and added that, for example, one of the first was going to be to divest
all limos forthwith, along with the new fifteen-million-dollar Gulfstream IV
he'd bought for weekend fishing trips down in the Keys, and direct the proceeds
toward capital investment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>From there on things progressed pretty much as might be
expected. By the time they reached his paneled office she had been obliged to
explain that his options were either (1) to get in line, or (2) to watch DNI
pick up another thirty percent of his company's O-T-C shares, then march him
and his &quot;golden parachute&quot; past a stockholders' vote they would call
to review his career options. After that she had claim to his unalloyed
attention.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was a tough Friday. After she flew back late, she dropped
by the office to pick up a few things and fill me in on how it went.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good. You're still here.&quot; She popped her head
around my office door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who won? The Christians or the lions?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Want to hear about it?&quot; She came on in and dropped
her briefcase on the desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Wouldn't miss it for the world.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, you should have seen the look on that man's
face.&quot; She clicked open the case and pulled out the action plan she'd
developed for XYZ. She was exhausted but still wired. &quot;These CEOs forget
it's shareholders who own the companies and pay their salaries. They start
thinking they're little Caesars.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, those are the kinds of operators who used to be my
clients. Believe me, I know the type.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She then proceeded to give me the rundown. Outfit XYZ
specialized in high-tech widgets it sold in the </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Latin America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, and </span><span style='font-size:
 10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Europe</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. Problem: their widgets cost too much, broke down more than
they should, and consequently folks didn't tend to buy them the way they once
did. As a result XYZ had dropped about five million last quarter and
(unbeknownst to its workers) was currently on the verge of closing two of its
three U.S. plants and exporting the assembly operation someplace where it could
exploit two-dollar labor, a move that would tank just over a thousand American
jobs. Management says, gee, that's tragic, and awards itself another year-end
financial tribute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dr. Richardson had just dropped a bomb in the playpen. First
off, she told them, XYZ's damned widgets cost too much not because American
workers are overpaid, but because its assembly plants were a candidate for the
Smithsonian. Therefore, starting immediately, short-term profits as well as
dividends and all management compensation would be slashed and the resulting
capital, together with a new offering of long- term corporate equities, would
be invested in automating its facilities and retraining workers. There would,
in fact, only be workers in future, since all freeloading middle managers,
attorneys, and drones with titles such as 'administrative assistant' were to be
terminated. She gave them a list.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Henceforth, she went on, management would begin planning ten
years ahead, not three months. XYZ would concern itself with world competition
then, not now, and it would develop a substantially more diversified product
line to cushion slumps. As part of that shift, it would double the budget for R&amp;D
immediately and expand the lab. Innovation would once again be brought to the
product stage fast and adapted quickly to world markets. XYZ's new focus would
be on making its market share grow in the decade ahead, which also meant
cracking down on quality and halving the current customer-be-damned response
time on deliveries and service. Concerning those last items, product managers
would now be required to address customers' complaints personally. She figured
that in itself would turn around XYZ's substantial quality control debacle
overnight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally, there would be an immediate crash program to rectify
XYZ's costly illusion that English was the worldwide language of business.
These days, she explained, the language of business is the one your customer
speaks. Accordingly all XYZ's overseas operatives would be required to enroll
in intensive language training now, including formal study of the history and
social customs of their territory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sounds like you let him have it with both barrels. Keep
on like this, and the U.S. of A. may never be the same.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the idea. One company down and about three
thousand to go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What's that saying about a journey of miles and miles
starting with the first step? Well, she'd taken the step. The future lay ahead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, can I buy you a drink?&quot; I was winding up the
day, the week. &quot;You've earned it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Like nothing better.&quot; She was repacking her
briefcase. &quot;Matt, I'm having the time of my life. All the things I've
always wanted to do. This is like a fantasy come true. We're going to pull this
off, wait and see.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Could be.&quot; I was switching off the lights in my
office. &quot;Tell you something though, Doctor. I keep wondering what will
happen when Noda gets through with us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thoughts?&quot; She glanced back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, after </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
takes over half the companies in this country and starts running them right,
then what?&quot; We were headed for the security doors. &quot;But maybe we
ought to talk about that some other time. And place.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll think about it tomorrow. Just now I'm
bushed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tomorrow, in case you've lost count, is Saturday. Don't
know about you, but I'm taking the day off. The hell with Japanese business
hours. My daughter comes this weekend.&quot; We were saluted by heavies in the
security airlock, then the doors opened. &quot;Matter of fact, we're going to
eat somewhere down in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>SoHo</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> tonight. Care to join us? Be warned
it'll be mostly soy by-products and brown rice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd love to meet her.&quot; She looked at me.
&quot;Matthew Walton with a daughter. My God.&quot; She laughed. &quot;Sorry,
Matt, but you really don't seem the father type.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Amy's mother said approximately the same thing as she
was packing her bags. But I'm now undergoing intensive on-the-job father
training. Fact is, I'd planned to knock off around Christmas and take her down
to ou</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> in the islands, though now I'm not
sure there'll be time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sounds very fatherly. You should go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm still hoping to.&quot; I looked her over again.
&quot;Well, the hell with it, why mince words. Tell me, Tam, how's your love
life these days?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She burst out laughing again. &quot;You haven't changed a
bit. Not at all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Spare the commentary, okay? Just stick to the
question.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Excuse me, counselor. The honest answer is it's
nonexistent, which you surely must know, since I'm here every night till </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>midnight</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> just as you are.&quot; She examined me pointedly.
&quot;Matthew, could this conceivably be construed as a proposition? To a
horny, bone-tired woman in her moment of mental fatigue?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It might be a tentative gesture in that direction. I'm
a slow mover.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You always were.&quot; She finished buttoning her coat.
&quot;What time's dinner?&quot;</span></p>

<h1> <span style='font-size:14.0pt'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:1.0pt;color:windowtext'><img
width=32 height=32 src="images/image013.jpg" alt=""></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Over the next couple of weeks I began to wonder if the
scenario wasn't going a little too smoothly. Everything about Noda's setup
seemed surprisingly pat. The answers came too easily. Was it all really what it
seemed?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I should also add that in the fortnight since </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tarn</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s first contact with </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>'s shell-shocked industrialists, the situation had not gone
unnoticed in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Washington</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Tuesday of the second week Jack
O'Donnell called and left a message downtown with Emma, asking if I could
arrange a meeting for him with the elusive Matsuo Noda. Although I'd tried to
keep Jack informed as to developments, he still wanted to confront </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s New Age maker face-to-face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Walton,&quot; he said when I got back to him, &quot;I
just heard your guy's too 'busy' to meet the press, but maybe he'd chat with a
close, longtime friend of his American attorney. That's me, in case you don't
recognize the description. Why not try and get me in to see him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're dreaming, Jack.&quot; I told him that a </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> senator was about the last person Matsuo Noda would
be interested in meeting just now. &quot;Don't hold your breath, but I'll bring
it up and see what he says.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And what do you know! Noda declared that nothing would please
him more. Naturally there had to be a few ground rules about
confidentiality—this was after all a delicate corporate situation—but otherwise
he'd be delighted to chat. You could have knocked me over with a feather.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thus around </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>two
 P.M.</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> Thursday, Jack
O'Donnell arrived at the new twelfth-floor operation, ready to get the truth or
by God know the reason why. After he made his way past our Uzi- outfitted
reception, I brought him on through the floor and introduced him to Dr.
Richardson. Jack knew of her writings</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>and hit the
ground running, asking who, why, when, where, etc., but before he could get any
real answers, Noda appeared and took over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>O'Donnell confided later that his first impression of Matsuo
Noda matched perfectly my description of the man—every bit central casting's
image of the in-charge Japanese honcho. After the usual routine pleasantries,
Jack said he'd like to record their talk. Noda politely demurred, saying
recording instruments stifled his spontaneity, then proceeded to laud Jack's
own articles and speeches urging American industry to get its house in order.
Senator Jack O'Donnell, he declared, was a visionary American statesman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jack accepted this praise warily, then asked if he could
maybe have a peek at the computer operation on the floor below, the analytical
armory I'd told him about. Again Noda begged off, claiming he'd be honored to
guide the esteemed senator's tour personally, but surely they'd both prefer to
postpone that until such time as they had the leisure to review the operation
in detail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jack sensed, and I did too, that he was getting a polite
runaround, so he decided to get down to business. He clicked open his briefcase
and took out a notebook.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Noda,&quot; he began, &quot;there's been
considerable speculation in Washington this past couple of weeks regarding the
specific intent of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s sudden heavy involvement in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s high-tech sector. My subcommittee
has monitored foreign investment here for a number of years, and frankly I've
never seen anything remotely like what's now underway. I'd appreciate an
informal briefing, unless you wish to open the regrettable possibility of a
formal subpoena to appear before our subcommittee.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whereupon Jack received the first whoosh of what soon
blossomed into a roomful of aerosol bullshit. Noda started with some malarkey
about the great tradition of economic cooperation between our peoples, advanced
to balderdash about Japan's desire to share her resources with the world's less
fortunate, then outdid himself with triple-distilled crapola about the timeless
trust and regard his country's ordinary citizens cherished in their hearts for
our Christian nation (which had merely torch-bombed and nuked them a few
decades past). Worst of all, Jack had to sit there and listen. I've never seen
the guy so uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Clearly Noda intended to give him pure <i>tatemae </i>-
soothing generalities that added up to zip. The man was, by God, going to do
exactly what he wanted, all of which was perfectly legal, so he didn't really
see any point in drawing a picture for the U.S. Senate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally Jack just closed his notebook. &quot;Let me put this
differently. I understand that your objectives are not merely acquisition, but
also an attempt to rejuvenate </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> business. Beginning, I take it, with
the lackluster segments of our high-tech sector?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We hope to offer suggestions from time to time that may
prove helpful.&quot; Noda just sat there like a sphinx. &quot;Perhaps I can
offer an example. As you doubtless know, Senator, Japanese firms build plants
overseas these days primarily to be more competitive in those foreign markets.
You Americans, however, are moving your manufacturing abroad now mainly to
compete with foreign goods here it home in your own market. You appear to think
it as comparable, but of course it is not. What you are doing is exporting your
own jobs. Your strategy is defensive, ours is offensive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jack looked him squarely in the eye. &quot;Quite frankly I
must tell you that not everyone in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Washington</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
these days trusts </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s 'offensive' in international
trade. I for one would be very interested in knowing exactly why </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> has chosen to invest billions of dollars in keeping </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s manufacturing alive. Particularly
when so much of it is competitive with your own.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, Senator, I realize you Americans prize
frankness.&quot; He wasn't giving an inch. &quot;Very well. Quite honestly, no
one in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> believes it is in the interest of
the Free World to allow your industrial base to continue its current decline.
Our economic condition is linked to yours, like the vital organs of Siamese
twins. We cannot afford to let you atrophy. For one thing, you are our only
defense shield, since we have none of our own. I might also add, though it is a
comparatively lesser concern, you are </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s
primary customer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what you're proposing—if you'll permit me to
paraphrase—is to take certain of our strategic industries, the ones in trouble,
by the neck and institute the management, investment, and research necessary to
keep them competitive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda just smiled. &quot;Dai Nippon expects to offer
occasional</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>advice in
the spirit of friendly cooperation. Which is why,&quot; he went on, &quot;I am
so happy to have this opportunity to review our program with someone such as
yourself. Your understanding of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s
industrial malaise has not gone unnoticed by those Japanese who take the longer
view, who worry about world economic stability.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jack tugged at his silk tie and nodded his thanks. Then Noda
continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You will be pleased to know I have been in contact with
the Japanese trade organizations that have political action committees, or PACs
as you call them, in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Washington</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Last year we distributed over fifty
million dollars . . . at least if you believe the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee's staffers . . . in an effort to clarify misunderstandings about </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s trade and investment position here.&quot; He
smiled. &quot;That averages out to about a million dollars per state, to take a
somewhat clinical view. Of course I will try to use my influence to see what
our PACs can do to help you next fall.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Noda, your expression of support is, naturally,
appreciated.&quot; Jack was turning politician again. &quot;However, you should
be aware of Section 441(e) of the Federal Election Campaign Act, which states
that 'no foreign national shall make a contribution, or an implied promise to
make a contribution, in connection with any federal public office.' I don't
think this discussion is proper.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That law says nothing about PACs of duly incorporated
American subsidiaries of foreign-owned organizations, Senator. For example,
Sony of America and a coalition of Japanese investors recently contributed
hundreds of thousands to legislators of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Florida</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
and </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>California</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> to encourage the defeat of those
states' unfair unitary taxes on foreign-owned companies. Sometimes it's
necessary to remind your federal and state governments that Japanese investment
can be very problematical in an uncongenial environment.&quot; He smiled.
&quot;Americans investing overseas have a long history of making their
interests known to those governments; why should Japanese businessmen be
expected to do otherwise?&quot; All of a sudden Noda glanced at his watch, rose
abruptly, and bowed. &quot;Well, the afternoon seems to have gotten away from
us. I wish you to know I am extremely honored you've taken time from your
undoubtedly busy schedule to visit with us, Senator. It has been most pleasant.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He shook hands with Jack as he continued. &quot;Of course I
have not yet had the opportunity to review the thinking of the man expected to
oppose you in next fall's senate contest. I believe he is Representative Mark
Reynolds, is he not?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jack's polite smile sort of froze on his face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But, I'm sure I will,&quot; Noda proceeded blandly.
&quot;Again let me stress that voices such as yours are important. There are so
few opinion-makers in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, individuals such as Dr. Richardson
and yourself, who have the receptivity to appreciate the importance of Dai
Nippon's program and its objectives.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I quickly offered to show the distinguished senator to the
door, hoping I wouldn't need that Christmas-gift dog muzzle. He was still
closing his briefcase as we passed the guards, a couple of guys who looked like
the heavies in an old Bruce Lee karate epic. Click, we were on the elevator,
click, we were headed down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good Christ!&quot; He exploded. Before he could say
anything else, I waved for silence. Around here the walls probably had ears.
(Shortly thereafter I discovered I'd underestimated even that.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In minutes we were on </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Third Avenue</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>, autumn wind in our hair, with O'Donnell positively
awestruck by Matsuo Noda's balls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, did I hear what I thought I did?&quot; His eyes
were grim.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That he's got X million bucks that say you get retired
if you fuck with him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My reading was, I play ball with him and his crowd and
he'll write a blank check for my campaign next year. I cross him and I'll be
watching the Mark Reynolds show every night on prime time right through
election day.&quot; He was livid. &quot;Matt, take my advice and get out of
this thing. That bastard thinks this country's for sale. If he expects me to
run interference for him on the Hill while he gears up for World War Three, he's
making a big mistake.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jack, I can't quit now. Who else is going to keep an
eye on this guy? Besides, he'd never let me. I know too much.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what? He's got to be stopped.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, if you're so worried, then deliver a major speech
on the Senate floor. About all these Japanese billions rolling in, absorbing
companies, with a lot of samurai fanning out to take</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>names and
kick ass across the boardrooms of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
It ought to get picked up by the Nightly News. Then we'll see what the country
wants to do about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The problem, obviously, was what <i>could</i> the country do
about it. And more than that, where would it eventually lead? Did anybody—Tam
Richardson included—seriously believe this was merely a temporary helping hand?
History had a practice of going in one direction—forward. So after Noda had
acquired a lot of our high-tech outfits, maybe even kept them from going the
way of Mostek and others, what next? More and more I was beginning to wonder if
this was really preferable to our blundering along as best we could on our own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After gazing at the sky a minute, he declared he was going to
do exactly what I'd said. Blow the whistle. He was about to write a speech that
would be read the length of America, maybe even in the White House—unless, as
Henderson claimed, nobody there these days read anything but TelePrompTers.
Nobody was going to buy off Jack O'Donnell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I watched as he bulldozed a matron and her fur-collared pooch
out of the way to grab the next cab for his midtown office. On the way back
through the lobby I stopped off and grabbed a copy of <i>Time</i>. Had we made
the weeklies yet?</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Yep. Lead article, all about how the Japanese loved
investing here. Going up in the elevator, though, I happened to flip past a
profile of some recently disappeared luminary in the academic world, the guy
who was supposed to have been the father of artificial intelligence. It
occurred to me the piece might be of interest to Tam. She'd been so busy she
was probably out of touch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When I got back up to twelve, Noda was gone. Vanished almost
as though he hadn't been there. I wanted to huddle with Tam about his evasive
new song and dance, but since I was holding the magazine, I showed her the
item. The rest of what happened you can probably guess. She had been out of
touch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, my God, Allan!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Friend of yours? I'm sorry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nobody told me.&quot; She grabbed it and quickly
skimmed the article. Finally she headed for her office. &quot;I've got to call
Sarah.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam.&quot; I caught her arm. I'd finally made the
connection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&quot;I
think I already know the story.&quot; Then I recounted </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s bizarre tale.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was the first time though not the last that I saw Tam
Richardson look scared. She obviously knew something I didn't.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matthew, something is very, very wrong.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just repeating what I heard.&quot; I looked at her, now
twisting the magazine in her hands, and decided to press. &quot;Is there more
to this than you're telling me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know.&quot; She glanced around. &quot;I really
don't want to talk about it here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Whatever you say.&quot; I paused. &quot;How well did
you know him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He had dinner at my apartment not more than a couple of
months ago.&quot; She tossed down the magazine. &quot;And he asked me to do
something for him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did you?&quot; Don't know why I asked. It just seemed
relevant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No. I guess you could say I did just the opposite. Now
it all makes me wonder if . . . if maybe it has some connection with . .
.&quot; Her voice trailed off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What? What connection?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing.&quot; She was starting to clam up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She didn't say anything more. And, so far as I know, that
phone call never got made.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Besides, something else occurred that night to occupy her
mind. When she got home, she picked up her mail and decided to crash. She'd
been so busy she still hadn't finished with all the odds and ends that had
stacked up during the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> trip, but that night she was too
knocked-out to bother. She poured herself a glass of white wine, quickly
checked the mail, and was getting ready for bed when she first noticed the
light flashing on her answering machine. For a minute she considered just
letting it wait. There was nobody she wanted to talk with who wouldn't still be
there in the morning. But finally curiosity got the upper hand, and she pushed
&quot;Play.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was only one message. In Japanese.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ms. Akira Mori wanted to see her Friday morning, at the DNI
offices. It wasn't a request; it was a summons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Wait one minute! Mori? When did she get into town? And more
to the point, where did Mori-san come off summoning Tam Richardson for a
command appearance? She had another</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>glass of
wine and finally went to bed wondering who exactly was now running the show at
DNI.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Friday late she awoke still thinking about Allan. What was
going on? She was beginning to get worried, and maybe a little frightened.
Finally, just before lunchtime, she got her briefcase and hailed a cab for
uptown.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After she cleared the checkpoint at the twelfth-floor
elevators, she spotted Mori-san, right there in the midst of the action. This
woman wastes no time, she told herself. Mori, an incongruous peacock of
designer elegance in the midst of the bustling, short-haired staff, was poring
over a stack of printouts assembled on a desk in the center of the floor.
Meanwhile, the office was going full tilt: the green print of CRT screens
glowed; printers hummed all around; data bleeped between terminals; and
staffers were hurrying over selected documents for Mori to review. Also, since
heavy buys were underway, the latest SEC filings (required when one entity
acquires more than five percent of the stock of a given company) were being
readied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As it happens, I was already on hand too, over in Noda's
office where we were going over some paperwork. The day's news as far as I was
concerned also was Mori-san. She'd appeared bright and early, held a
closed-door confab with Noda, proceeded to do some photocopying, then
commandeered an office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By purest coincidence I was doing some copying of my own
round about then and ended up on the copy line right behind her, inhaling her
perfume. Next an odd thing happened. As we all sometimes do when rushed, she'd
snatched up her copies while the last original was still on the machine. Then
she asked me if I wanted regular size or legal. Legal, I said, and she reached
to flip the switch. As she did, though, she accidentally clicked the
&quot;print&quot; button with those long fingernails, whereupon she stalked off,
rummaging through her copies and forgetting the original.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Not for long. Two seconds later she was back to claim it, but
by that time an unauthorized copy was lying in the output bin. I didn't even
see it. However, when I scooped up my own pages a minute later, mixed in with
them was a sheet listing some names and numbers with REVISIONS lettered across
the top. I started to toss it, then paused to glance over the names for a
moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hang on, everybody, this is very out of line. That's when I
decided to slip it into my briefcase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When Mori saw Tam come in, she quickly stacked the printouts
she was reviewing into a neat pile, then beckoned her toward the far corner of
the floor. Tam noticed that Mori's new office was at the opposite end of the
building from Noda's.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I understand Noda-san has appointed you director of
this division.&quot; Mori was ushering Tam into the office, all the while
running her fingers nervously through her sculptured black hair.
&quot;Congratulations.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Not exactly a great opener. It sounded even harsher in
Japanese, since it was so at odds with the usual polite greetings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've been hired to do a job, Mori-san, and I intend to
do</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>So desu ne</i>,&quot; Mori concurred in Japanese,
her voice a trifle strained. Tam thought she looked a bit bleary-eyed after her
flight in from </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, but there were no half measures
about the woman. She was all business in a prim silk suit shading to gray with
a bright blue scarf tied at the neck. She wore high heels, but they didn't slow
her brisk stride as she paced around her desk. &quot;I am sure you will do it
well. I would like you to know I am prepared to assist you at every step.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, Tam had a pretty clear idea of how she intended to
proceed, which didn't really include a lot of assistance from Akira Mori. What
exactly had Noda been telling this woman? Maybe, she mused, Mori-san just
hadn't been fully brought up to speed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I noticed that you're reviewing our analytical
sheets.&quot; Tam continued, &quot;Those are the firms we're going to start
restructuring first.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And if you do not receive the desired cooperation? What
will you do then?&quot; Mori asked evenly, as though she didn't already know
the answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'll just keep up stock acquisition till we have
whatever we need. Also, I intend to appoint a representative to sit on the board
of directors, to monitor performance and make sure our program is
implemented.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is my understanding as well.&quot; Mori went on,
&quot;And concerning the matter of who will be assigned—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've just finished putting together a list of
management experts. They're dedicated people. Most of them will probably help
us for a small honorarium instead of their usual consulting fees.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;These personnel are an area I wish to discuss with
you,&quot; Mori pushed ahead, almost as though not listening. That was when Tam
realized she was finally getting around to the real agenda of the meeting.
&quot;It is our opinion that, at this stage, the heavy involvement of Americans
in that capacity would be counterproductive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;'Our opinion'?&quot; Tam didn't like the sound of this.
&quot;Who exactly is 'our'?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have reviewed Dai Nippon's program in some detail
with . . . the interested parties in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Tokyo</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.&quot;
Mori appeared to be making an announcement. &quot;They have concurred that at
this stage it would be more efficient if we assigned our own specialists to
assist in the management of these companies.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your own specialists?&quot; Now Tam was starting to
bristle. &quot;Just whom do you have in mind?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Industrial experts such as Kenji Asano, for example,
may be involved.&quot; She continued, &quot;We have a great reservoir of talent
to choose from, particularly within the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;MITI?&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>Tarn</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
stared at her, dumbfounded. She couldn't believe her own ears. That was like
calling in a fox to fortify your henhouse. &quot;You've got to be joking.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The decision was made last week.&quot; Mori fixed her
coldly. &quot;Noda-san has been informed, and he finds the suggestion . . .
acceptable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I don't,&quot; Tam flared. &quot;It's
outrageous.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There is something you must understand, Dr.
Richardson,&quot; Mori continued in Japanese. &quot;The management of a company
should represent its ownership. Since Dai Nippon will be holding what amounts
to a controlling interest in these firms, we are obliged to assist them using
whatever international specialists we feel are most qualified to contribute.
For now we believe that the expertise in our Ministry of International Trade
and Industry is most appropriate since it has guided corporate growth in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> for many years with undeniable success.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's irrelevant.&quot; Tam steamed. &quot;First, most
MITI executives don't necessarily understand American business. And second,
MITI has no right involving itself in the operation of our industry. It's a
flagrant conflict of interest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There I must disagree with you. On your first point,
many Japanese firms have been manufacturing here and have an excellent record
of labor relations and management success. As to your second point, using
specialists trained by MITI is simply the most efficient way to transfer
Japanese expertise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It won't be allowed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why shouldn't it be? Any people we bring here will be
on leave of absence. Hence they will no longer have any official ties to the
Japanese government. No law prevents us from appointing whomever we wish.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ouch, Tam thought. She's right. Nothing could stop Dai Nippon
from restructuring the boards of directors of the companies in which it held a
voting majority of shares. In fact, several Japanese firms had already taken
over and reopened the manufacturing facilities of some of the very companies
MITI's &quot;targeting&quot; had decked only a few years before, bringing in
Japanese board members as part of the deal. What's more, Americans loved it.
Governors were falling over themselves to attract Japanese joint ventures to
their states.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Does Noda-san understand the significance of bringing
in MITI personnel?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There are many interests to be addressed . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At this point I wandered in, together with Noda, to talk
about setting up a meeting that afternoon. We'd been reviewing DNI's plans for
a new program of real estate investment and construction, part of expanding the
research or manufacturing facilities of the firms it was now in the process of
absorbing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I passed a pleasantry with Tam, then studied her, puzzled.
&quot;You look a little distressed this morning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm receiving an update on a change in our
program.&quot; Tam glared back at Mori, then turned to Noda. &quot;What's this
about bringing in people from MITI?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda smiled, but he looked a trifle uncomfortable.
&quot;Think of it as a temporary measure.&quot; He nodded toward Mori, then looked
back at Tam. &quot;We always like to operate by consensus. And that consensus
among the fund managers who have joined us appears to be that our investments
should initially be monitored by our own people.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I thought this office was going to be in charge of
determining who our people would be, not somebody in MITI.&quot; Tam fixed him
coldly, then turned on me. &quot;Did you know anything about this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bringing in honchos from MITI? News to me.&quot; I
examined Noda. &quot;I understood the management end of this was going to be
directed by Dr. Richardson.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was smiling again. &quot;But it will be. She will continue
to meet with the CEOs of the firms we intend to assist to provide our
preliminary analysis of their operations, and she will be with us every step we
take.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It hardly sounds that way.&quot; Tam was boiling.
&quot;The way it looks now, I set up a reorganization plan, then MITI's people
come in and take over.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Merely for consultation, Dr. Richardson. I assure
you.&quot; He glanced uncomfortably at Mori-san. Both Tam and I had the same
hunch at that point: Noda's backers had started to get a little edgy about his
investments, so they'd decided to send in some brass from the Delta Force to
keep an eye on things. But you'd never have suspected that as he continued,
&quot;Dr. Richardson, surely you must be aware that MITI personnel are not in
the habit of, as you phrase it, 'taking over.' At most MITI merely recommends
policies to enhance competitiveness. Furthermore, the individuals we will
engage will no longer be associated with MITI. They will merely be specialists
in our hire. Their participation will be extremely beneficial, please believe
me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If making decisions like this is your idea of
consensus, then I don't think much of it.&quot; Tam was getting increasingly
wound up. &quot;And I'll tell you something else. I intend to review the
government connections of anyone you bring in. I'm going to have final
say.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We all want to work together,&quot; Noda continued
smoothly. &quot;Our plans are continuing to evolve. Of course I will insist on
full American-Japanese coordination and cooperation at every stage.&quot; He
looked squarely at Tam. &quot;You have my word.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She glanced over at me, trying her best to keep cool. I was
toying with my papers, still posing as a neutral observer, but I was equally
puzzled. Why would </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s Ministry of International Trade
and Industry let its people be used to assist American companies? Okay, MITI's
elite technocrats were probably the cream of </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>'s management talent, but they already had their hands full.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>More to the point, given MITI's sorry history of rule bending
and economic guerrilla warfare, why would it now cooperate in Dai Nippon's plan
to restructure the high-tech segment of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
manufacturing? I asked Noda point-blank.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton, if you choose to see </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
as competitors, then I suppose you could regard this as our ancient tradition
of 'giving salt to the enemy.'&quot; He smiled awkwardly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Bullshit. That's what I thought, not what I said, which was
nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam in the meantime had her own question to chew on. Mori had
mentioned Ken Asano. Was he involved too? Since Mori had specifically named him
as being on the MITI team that she or somebody now planned to enlist, was this
a tip-off that Ken was in with them up to his neck? Was this the
&quot;trust&quot; he'd talked about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since Tam looked as if she was getting ready to resign on the
spot, I figured a little cooling-off time for everybody might be in order.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Richardson, if we're about through here, could you
help me a minute?&quot; I thumbed toward the open door. &quot;Tanaka wants you
to approve the final setup for the partitions.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I quickly discovered I was wrong about the idea she would
quit. As we worked our way past the computer terminals and stacks of printouts,
retreating toward the center of the floor, she declared war. &quot;MITI or Mori
or whoever's behind this is going to have a fight on their hands. We don't need
them involved.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I think we're
being kept in the dark about a lot of what's cooking.&quot; I kept my voice
low, scarcely above a whisper, as the Japanese staff milled in and out.
&quot;There's a sheet of paper in my briefcase that I'd like to go over with
you. Yet another example of the curious new developments around this
place.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She poured herself a cup of green tea from the large urn stationed
in the middle of the floor. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'll talk about it later.&quot; I poured some tea for
myself. &quot;I think something's gone haywire.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That startled her, and she began to tune in. &quot;Things are
pretty haywire now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This may be even worse. I came across something a while
ago that doesn't add up.&quot; I looked at her. &quot;I think we ought to talk
about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not here. How about tonight?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can't. There's a damned faculty dinner I have to
attend.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then tomorrow night?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What would you say to my place downtown? I think you
live right around the corner from me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This has to be strictly business, Matt.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Guaranteed.&quot; I raised my palm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I've got a lot of work—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shall we make it for seven?&quot; I was handing her my
card, address and number thereon. &quot;The cocktail hour?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was still glaring at Mori's office as she absently took
it. &quot;Well . . . all right.&quot; She glanced back. &quot;Seven.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;See you there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. . . Jack O'Donnell's speech, to be delivered to the Senate
that Tuesday, sort of slipped to the back of my mind. Maybe it shouldn't have.
After getting back to his office that afternoon he dictated about three
versions before he had it the way he wanted it. Friday morning he messengered a
copy down to my office, and I can tell you it was a beauty. He'd got it all,
and he'd got it right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Later Friday, however, he received a phone call from Matsuo
Noda. After the usual preliminaries, saying how much he'd enjoyed their
meeting, Mr. Noda confided he was calling as a personal favor to the senator,
since they'd hit it off so well the previous day. Turns out he'd just been
talking to the CEOs of various Japanese outfits scheduled to set up
manufacturing operations in some of the &quot;rust-belt&quot; mill towns in
upstate </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Here was the distressing development:
seems they were all of a sudden taking another look at sunny </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tennessee</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. The problem was, they were upset by
the anti-Japanese tone a lot of New York publications were taking these
days—Japan bashing in the Times editorial pages, things like that. Noda,
however, felt all this was very shortsighted of those Japanese investors; and
he wondered if Senator O'Donnell would like him to put in a word for the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Empire</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>State</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
Pause. He hated to mention this, but people were even talking of closing
certain Japanese-operated factories already in place, such as that big one in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Elmira</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, Jack's hometown, and moving them
south. But he thought threats such as that were very impolite and he was hoping
he could find time to straighten the whole thing out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That Saturday turned out to be the day when winter descended
abruptly and with rare vengeance. Remember we're only talking mid-December,
still a dozen full shopping days till you know what, but it could have been the
depths of January. After things kicked off with what seemed a foot of snow
around three, the elements really started to unload. Everything from sleet in
historic proportions to a wind-chill that would have frosted the horns off a </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bexar</span><span style='font-size:

style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> billy goat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While I waited for Tam, I battened down the garden, covered
the outdoor furniture, and prudently provisioned the larder with a flagon of
Remy antifreeze. Ben in the meantime was lumbering around downstairs, eyeing
the snow-covered garden with an air of disgruntlement. The universe had turned
unacceptable, something he never greeted with equanimity. I decided to try and
divert his misery by hauling him up on the long Country French dining table and
combing some of the knots out of his shag. When that merely reinforced his
overall gloom, however, I called it quits, located a consoling rawhide stick
for him to gnaw, and poured a brandy. It was along about then, shortly after
nightfall, that Tam finally appeared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A cab with snow chains dropped her off (she'd come directly
from the office, which Noda had just shut down for the weekend), and I helped
her navigate the sleet-covered steps. I got the immediate sense that her first
impression of my living quarters was unchanged from the old days. In spite of
all the art, armor, and antiques, the place had a poignant rootlessness about
it. Boys like toys; they just get more expensive as the bank account grows.
Also, since she'd been in the man game long enough to spot a divorce-rebound
case a mile off, she probably had me figured from the start: part of that army
of emotional paraplegics in our feckless day and age.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After the MITI twist, however, I suppose she was ready to
consult with somebody concerning the direction things were headed. I warmly
invited her downstairs to the sisal-carpeted den just off the garden and dumped
some logs in the fireplace. Next I pulled out a few discs—Mendelssohn seemed
about right for some reason—and offered to whip up a batch of margaritas. 'Twould
be, I dared to hope, a long winter's eve. Alas, she said no thanks, a club soda
and lime would do fine. Looked as if I would be working barehanded, without aid
of that universal socializer, distilled spirit, so I rustled up a Perrier, then
poured another snifter of brandy for myself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since she appeared exhausted, my first suggestion was she
kick off her shoes and get comfortable. No argument.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After settling in, shoes off and feet to the fire, she
announced she was ready to hear what I'd come up with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before an awkward silence could grow, I snapped open my
briefcase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Richardson, in keeping with the ground rule that
this is a formal business meeting, let me introduce my first agenda item.&quot;
I flashed her my best smile, then pulled out the purloined page. &quot;This is
part of the paperwork Mori seems to have brought with her. I don't understand
too well what it's all about, but my first impression is that somebody has
decided to do some major tinkering with your program. Take a look at this and
give me an opinion.&quot; I passed it over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She glanced down, then back at me. &quot;Are you supposed to
be bringing DNI documents home?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was her first reaction, swear to God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, this just accidentally got in with some of my
photocopies. All it is is a list of companies. And I didn't want to talk about
it there in the office.&quot; I reached over and ran my finger down the string
of firms, then to several columns of numbers off to the right. &quot;The
question is, what are these outfits suddenly doing on DNI's buy list?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She studied it a second, looked around the room, and said
exactly nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Doesn't that seem at all strange to you?&quot; I
finally spoke up. &quot;As I understand the plan, you want to shift more
corporate funding into research in the companies you're buying into? I do have
it right, don't I?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She nodded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, then you're with me so far. But take a look at
this.&quot; I indicated the column of numbers. &quot;That's the current
research budget for these firms—it says so right up there on the top.
Presumably these figures came out of the analytical setup down on eleven. Does
anything about those figures seem out of line?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked at it, her eyes widening, then narrowing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I don't know what this sheet is all about.&quot;
She glanced up. &quot;These companies aren't part of our buys.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Got news for you. I think they just made the
team.&quot; I pointed to the heading. &quot;See that—'ACQUISITION SCHEDULE:
REVISIONS.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When she said nothing, nada, I continued, &quot;But you're
right; they weren't on the original list. The reason being, I would surmise, that
they didn't need any of this so-called management Rx you guys are supposed to
be cooking up. Look at that one, and that one. Even I know enough to realize
those outfits are operating with a real cash surplus right now, have plenty of
R&amp;D funding already, and hence are doing just fine, thank you. The figures,
in fact, are right over there in that column on the right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, we don't know what this is for.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;True, true. So let's just play pretend. And to make it
fun, let me show you something else.&quot; I rummaged through my briefcase some
more, finally extracting another paper. &quot;I copied a corresponding page
from the file on current buys.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I laid it alongside the first.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She picked up the second sheet, checked it over. &quot;I
helped compile this list.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then maybe you'll see what I'm saying? Format's the
same. The only difference is, some of the dogs have been dropped and replaced
by some very well run corporations.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're right about that. All high-tech, heavy research
investment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Progress? The first scale to fall from her eyes?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then let's play another round of this 'pretend' game.
As I understand it, you and yours put together this original list of companies
for one main reason: lousy management. But all of a sudden the outfits in the
worst shape on list number one have disappeared on list number two. Meaning, I
would assume, that they're no longer part of the program, at least as it's laid
out on this revised version Mori must have brought in from Tokyo.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you trying to say?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For chrissake, what did she think I was trying to say?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, nothing much, I suppose. Except that it looks to me
like somebody's just knifed your program in the back. All of a sudden DNI's
going to start buying outfits that already have good management, not to mention
heavy research commitments. So what exactly is anybody supposed to be doing to
help them along?&quot; I paused. &quot;Maybe a better question is, who removed
those others, the ones now winging it on a hope and a prayer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She laid down the two pages side by side and began to compare
them in more detail, a finger here, a finger there. But strictly no comment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Along about then Ben got up and checked out the sleet-
covered garden, then lumbered back and plopped down beside us, clearly
expecting a pat for diligence in the line of duty. She remarked that English
sheepdogs always reminded her of a big flotaki rug. After that put-down she
returned to the lists. I hoped the poor guy's sensitive ego wasn't mortally
fractured.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, she announced finally, my so-called discovery didn't
add up to much.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, I officially have no opinion about this. It could
mean anything.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;Maybe the new twist is to start with
the companies that can benefit the most from coordination. Take on the easy job
first where the payoff will be greatest. Save the tough ones for later.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, sure. Who knows? It could all be very innocent,
right? I mean, for all we can tell, the moon might really be green
cheese.&quot; I wondered what had gotten into her all of a sudden. It was plain
as day what was happening. But instead of congratulating me on my sleuthing,
she was turning obtuse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell me exactly how you got this sheet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Like I said, more or less by accident.&quot; I told her
the story again. &quot;I was about to chuck it, then I took a second to mull it
over. That's when I got to wondering why the numbers seemed so inconsistent.
Next thing I noticed was the new list of players. All of a sudden the heavens
opened. A vision.&quot; I got up to freshen my brandy, then came back. She was
still sitting there, maybe too exhausted to think straight. &quot;But I take it
you don't believe my little epiphany means anything?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Since I don't know what it means, I'm not going to
engage in a lot of uninformed speculation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good Christ, I thought, what's happened to all her reputed
brilliance?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know,&quot; she went on, &quot;I don't think you
should be taking any more documents out of the office. There's a reason for all
the security.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, back off. I just have boundless curiosity.&quot; I
still couldn't fathom her lack of interest . . . no, make that hostility.
&quot;Look, I don't claim to understand how birds fly, how fish swim, or how
this whole damned picture fits together. However, my new, albeit uninformed,
observation is that Noda and Company are not exactly giving us the fine print
on their scenario. Exhibit A: this strange new list.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think some fresh air would be nice.&quot; She rose to
her feet, located her shoes, and strolled over to look out at the garden. The
sleet and snow was about a foot and a half deep. &quot;Why don't we go into the
back?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot; I stumbled to my feet. &quot;Do you have
any idea . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked at me a bit funny, then made some hand signals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Huh?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally I realized she was telling me she didn't want to say
anything more inside the house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Talk about paranoid! Suddenly the reason for all her hemming
and hawing over my little theft came clear. She actually thought we might be
bugged!  Get serious, lady.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Anyway, she gave me the cool-it sign, then calmly started
putting on her coat. Astounded by the possible dimensions of human mistrust, I
dug out a sweater from behind the couch and opened the door. She was still
nursing that damned designer water.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ben snapped to alertness and galloped to the door, whereupon
he confronted the weather. His strategic decision, executed with lightning
speed, was to switch into his patented &quot;zone defense&quot; surveillance
mode against backyard trespassers, which required staying inside where it was
warm. I gave him a pat, freshened his water bowl, and followed her out into the
snow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a brief lull in the weather. The sky glowed red
from all the streetlights, at least what you could see of it through the
surrounding brownstones and the leafless ailanthus tree at the back. I looked
around as Ben gave the fence one last survey, then plopped down and settled his
chin onto his paws with a grunt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam, I suppose, had finally concluded I wasn't pulling some
kind of loyalty check for Noda, so that was when she opened the real can of
worms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How long was she making copies? I mean, you were
standing right behind her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mori? I don't know. Less than a minute.&quot; I
examined her, a trifle puzzled. &quot;Why?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How many pages?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Probably half a dozen or so.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She just stood there a moment, gazing up at the sky, then she
went back inside, stepping around Ben, and returned with the sheet. &quot;Did
you notice this?&quot; She pointed to the upper right-hand corner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I took it and strained in the faint light from the back
windows. &quot;It says '129/147.'&quot; I looked up. &quot;You think that means
. . . ?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think your episode suggests at least two
things.&quot; She took back the page. &quot;The first one is, this is part of a
much larger document.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;With you so far. A hundred and forty-seven pages. And
the second?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You said she only made half a dozen copies, then
overlooked this?&quot; She paused. &quot;Don't you think Akira Mori can
count?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment the snowy night grew silent as a tomb.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you suggesting?&quot; I finally blurted it
out. &quot;That she left this on purpose?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe. But I don't have the slightest idea why.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Christ, you have a very mistrusting mind.&quot; I
slogged on through the snow for a few steps, then turned back. &quot;I'm
convinced it was accidental.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right, let's just say that's a possibility for now.
But what we do know for sure is we'd better get our hands on the rest of
this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, don't look at me. I'm already in this scam deeper
than I ever intended to be. I say we either play their way or cut and run. We
start getting too nosy and we could end up on the wrong end of one of those
Uzis.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, there's something else I noticed about the list.
It's ominous.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Care to elaborate?&quot; I kicked at the snow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, not out here. I'm freezing.&quot; She pulled her
coat a bit tighter. &quot;Is there someplace inside where we can talk?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've got an idea. But let's warm up first.&quot; I led
the way back in. The fire had died a bit, so she settled on the floor next to
the hearth, the smooth contours of her cheeks golden in the flickering light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sure you won't have a brandy after all. To combat the
chill?&quot; The quartet Opus 44, No. 1, was enveloping us, both violins
emerging out of the shadows.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked up and smiled. &quot;Maybe it would be nice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I fetched it, slid onto the floor next to her, and stretched
to stir the coals. Ben sauntered over to keep me honest, plunked down, and was
immediately out like a light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How're we doing for warmth?&quot; I propped the poker
against the side of the mantel, then reached over and touched her tangled hair
lightly with my fingertips. To my everlasting surprise, she leaned next to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Much better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe we should both bail out right now. Tonight. Why
not just go down to my place in the islands and monitor the apocalypse off the
satellite dish? Watch MITI eat </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was I joking? Only partially. Down home we have a saying
about folks with a certain . . . <i>je ne sais quoi</i>. They'd do to ride the
river with. In my book Tam was definitely one of the riders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The fire snapped and startled Ben, who glanced up, checked
out the sleet-covered garden, then grimly resumed his snooze. She reached over
and gave him a pat. The first time. &quot;You know, I can't believe MITI is
behind all this. I know at least one MITI person myself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know somebody in MITI?&quot; I was a trifle taken
aback. &quot;Who?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stared at the fire. &quot;His name is Kenji Asano. You
wouldn't have heard of him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I lay there for a moment listening to the quartet, my memory
registers running a quick sort. Then it came to me. Kenji Asano was the MITI
guy </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> said had masterminded </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s rape of the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
semiconductor industry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You actually know him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sure do.&quot; She smiled. &quot;Very well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shit. I didn't really need to hear this. &quot;That sounds
like a little more than a professional acquaintance.&quot; I looked at her for
confirmation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A little.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, I thought. Guess we're getting down to the straight
story here. Press on. &quot;Well, I have some news you may not like. This Asano
genius personally engineered the destruction of the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> industry in RAM chips. Probably the most devastating
sneak attack on </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> since </span><span style='font-size:
 10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Pearl Harbor</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stiffened. &quot;Who told you that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's just say I heard it. So what's this guy doing all
of a sudden saving </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> high-tech industry? He's already
cost this country tens of thousands of jobs and literally billions of
dollars.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't believe it. I know Ken. Sure, he works for
MITI, but his job is overseeing </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s
own research in supercomputers. He's very proud of their progress.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Oops. I swirled my snifter. &quot;Whatever you say. If that's
really true, then excuse me. I take it all back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked up—probably not believing my diplomatic
reversal—and watched as I casually slipped my arm around her waist. I couldn't
tell if she wanted it to happen or not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thinking I might have some momentum going, I reached back and
pulled a couple of wide cushions off the couch, stationed them by the fire,
then eased us both against them. I tried to do it with naturalness, finesse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It wasn't happening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matthew, underneath all that unnecessary bluster, which
is just as I remember, you're still a half-decent guy, which I also remember.
But I don't really think this is a good idea.&quot; She looked at me, her face
highlighted in the orange glow of the embers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I hope it's not because you have other
commitments.&quot; I heard my voice harden. &quot;Like maybe in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm just a little distracted tonight, that's all.&quot;
She watched as I trailed a finger around the hard tip of a nipple beneath her
shirt. Gently she moved my hand away. &quot;Don't start.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe I can at least get a rain check.&quot; I retired
from the field.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Possibly.&quot; She smiled, then gave me a telling
glance. &quot;A while ago you said something about anothe</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My soundproof chamber?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right.&quot; I rose. &quot;We're always open around
here for travelers on a frosty night.&quot; I helped her up. &quot;And for this
evening's special introductory offer, there's a hot tub down the hall. Why
don't you let me fill it, and you can unwind those muscles for a while,
Japanese-style or California-style or whatever. Do you good.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked me over a second, then smiled. &quot;Lots of nice,
loud running water?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Exactly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Off we went to the Italian-marble bathroom there off the
downstairs bedroom. I'd installed that little indulgence for Joanna back during
happier times; these days I used it as the world's largest laundry
hamper—ripping it out would have cost a fortune. Jo's revenge, I called the
thing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She marched in, took a look about the room, which had one of
those big tubs trimmed in redwood, and said it reminded her of a place near
Ise. She did at least have the discretion to omit the circumstances of that
occasion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What happened next sort of shook my cool, my being a good </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Texas</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> lapsed-Baptist. You see, I'd never bought into the
nudity-is-wholesome ethic of the Age of Aquarius. Passed me right by. I mean,
where's the fun in life without a little forbidden fruit? But Tam just began
shucking her clothes. Everything. Kept going till she'd even doffed her little
beige knickers, piling everything one piece at a time in a neat heap on the
counter. Just like that. While bold corporate raider Matt Walton stood there in
terminal astonishment, grasping the edge of the sink as if it were a life
preserver. My nonchalance was an Oscar-winning performance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now in the attire God gave her, she calmly inquired if I had
any bubble bath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, ah, sure, I mean, I suppose so, probably
somewhere around here. If not, there's probably a box of Tide in the
basement.&quot; I groped blindly in the cabinet and my hand fell upon a pink
bottle whose label read &quot;Mr. Bubble.&quot; What's this? Then I realized it
must be some suds stashed there by Amy. Bet she saw somebody soaking on TV and
concluded that's the way grown-up women behaved. My God, it's in their genes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I turned around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tell you one thing, Dr. Tamara Richardson was still in great</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>shape. All
of her. Was she pulling a tease number on me, or just doing what comes
naturally? Sad to say, I fear it was the latter. I guess she'd somehow
internalized this Japanese idea that nudity is no big deal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam&quot;—I finally found my voice—&quot;you're
something else. I know you're smart, and I'm beginning to remember you never
were all that retiring. How about refreshing me on a few of the other things I
seem to have forgot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think I wanted to be a boy.&quot; She laughed as she
sampled the water with her toe. &quot;I thought they had all the fun.&quot; Now
she was pouring in a test portion of Amy's Mr. Bubble. &quot;Then I found out
girls could do anything boys could, but usually better. So I stopped worrying
about it.&quot; She stepped in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Easy. You're talking to an unreconstructed male
chauvinist.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What else is new? You all are at heart. At least you
have the decency to admit it.&quot; She dumped in the remainder of the pink gunk.
Will somebody please tell me why women, all women, go for that stuff? An
exaggeration, you say? Ever see one turn it down?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, I'm trying to deprogram myself, but it's uphill
work.&quot; I watched as a perfectly formed breast disappeared beneath the
foam. &quot;I tend to be old-fashioned.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I recall all too well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, give me a chance.&quot; I leaned back against the
sink. &quot;You know, this striptease isn't helping repress my primal male
instincts a whole heck of a lot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, for somebody who's supposed to be an expert on </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, you've understood very little about us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Us?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know. I'm half and half.&quot; She flashed me a
Mona Lisa smile as she was wrapping her hair in a towel. I found myself
thinking that at least she shaves her underarms, a minor concession to conventional
propriety.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, so what. I'm an equal-opportunity seductionist.
That is, when I get the opportunity.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not making much headway tonight, I fear.&quot; Another
tricky smile. She was starting to drive me distracted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thought you'd never notice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, you're an emotional basket case. I've seen
plenty.&quot; She looked me over sympathetically. &quot;Sorry, but I've got
enough problems of my very own. You'll have to manage your own salvation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Could be you're just deceived by my sensitive
nature.&quot; I leaned against the counter, playing peek-a-boo with a tan
nipple now half-concealed in the bubbles. &quot;Mistaking it for brain
damage.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Uh, uh.&quot; She shook her head in the negative.
&quot;I read your gender pretty well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was beginning to get a little annoyed. Who needed this?
&quot;Tell you what, Dr. Richardson, for all my putative failings, I do happen
to possess a modest allotment of native wit. And my male intuition tells me
your dance card is full right now. That same right-brain perception also
suggests it has something to do with this MlTl honcho Asano.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> &quot;So?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So that upsets me for a couple of reasons, only one of
which will probably be of any interest to you. I don't think you have an
entirely open mind on the possibility MITI or somebody may be about to try and
nail this country to the wall. Because if you admitted that, you would also
have to admit something you apparently find distasteful to concede about your
Prince Charming.&quot; I watched her eyes grow sad. &quot;Stop me if I cross
the line from preaching to meddling—to use a little expression from my
youth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matthew, you've just ceased being nice.&quot; She
looked down. &quot;What do you do if you think you trust somebody and then you
find out maybe that trust is . . . misplaced?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Old Ecclesiasticus, back in Bible times, told us, 'In
the time of adversity, consider.' As advice goes, that's still probably sound
value for the dollar. Like for example, you might want to back off and do a
little thinking on whether Noda and his crowd have been using you, and me for
that matter, like a couple of patsies.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When she said nothing, I pressed on. &quot;I walk into the
office yesterday, the first thing I hear about is some MITI connection, then
tonight I hear about your MITI connection, and it's starting to sound like the
same tune. Like maybe these guys have been playing you like a violin.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Credibility. And low profile for MITI's grab. By
sending you out to meet the victims, they've thrown the hounds off the scent.
Dr. Save-American-Industry has come to help. You're so goddam clean, Tam.
Impeccable credentials. You're gold to those guys.&quot; I was set to give her
a blast, but I decided to try keeping the lid on for once. &quot;Maybe a better
question than why they chose you is why you went for it. How did they brainwash
you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nobody brainwashed me. I still think Noda's being
straight. He can think in global terms. That's a rarity.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And how about this Asano character? You sure gave me
the message to back off when I questioned his intentions.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe I've been thinking with something besides my head.&quot;
She sighed and leaned back. &quot;But then, maybe not. I have no reason to
believe he'd mislead me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, I don't know anything about the situation. But I
respectfully suggest you ought to reflect on that possibility.&quot; I looked
at her. &quot;By the way, I seem to remember you said there was something else
about the list that struck you as odd.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It has to do with the kind of research being done by
those new firms on the list. A pattern.&quot; She paused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What pattern?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd rather not say just yet. Until I'm sure. It's
probably just my imagination.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Something snapped inside me about then. Anger. Tam </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Richardson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, I was rapidly concluding, was being
used by those bastards. And as best I could tell, this idealistic woman
couldn't let herself believe it. The situation royally pissed me off. Even more
when I also suspected this Asano operator had somehow been playing fast and
loose with her heartstrings. I decided then and there I wasn't going to let
them get away with it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A strange psychology takes hold of you when you sense you've
been temporarily outflanked; I think it's that primal human response somebody
once dubbed flight or fight. You realize you've got two choices: you can either
stand your ground, or you can make a run for the sidelines. So what to do about
Dai Nippon and Noda and Mori and Asano? Right then and there I made a tactical
decision. I decided that—like the caveman facing the saber-toothed tiger—the
best defense would be to try and make the beast back off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>More to the point, it wasn't merely Tam that was imperiled.
Maybe </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s suspicions were right; maybe this
was the handshake that turned into a karate flip, the beginning of World War
II, Part B. So I figured I owed it to myself and everybody else to at least
uncover the truth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No entity, I've always believed, is unstoppable, no matter
how massive. There's always a soft underbelly somewhere. After a while any big
organization gets cocky and makes a blunder. Sometimes, in fact, you can lure
them into it. I concluded there was only one way to go, head-to-head with Dai
Nippon. You want peaches, you shake the tree.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, you've got your theories, I've got mine. But for
both our sakes, I think it's time we moved on them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; She looked up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I suggest we start with a little information gathering.&quot;
I turned on the hot water again, nice and noisy, then continued. &quot;What do
you say we go up and take a little private look around the offices.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tonight?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What better time. Weather alert, right? Nobody's there.
It's perfect. We can fast-talk the security, get in, and check the place
over.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And where, exactly, do you propose we look?&quot; She
examined me skeptically. &quot;I'm there every day.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How about that new office Mori commandeered for
herself. I think we ought to poke around and see what she's got. Maybe try and
locate the rest of that document, if nothing else.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not sure we ought to be doing anything quite that
drastic, at least not just yet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I didn't claim it was approved by Amy Vanderbilt. I
just say we ought to give it a shot. If we don't look into this, who will?
Maybe we'll find something to explain the so-called pattern you think you
see.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, for all I know, that may be nothing more than a
coincidence. If Noda found out we'd done something like this, the whole ball
game would be over.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the chance we take. Let's just see what we can
come up with, okay? Personally, I'm beginning to think Noda and your pal Asano
are both world-class con artists.&quot; I poured a little more cognac for us
both. &quot;But whoever's right, we should at least try to find out. Who knows?
What if it's becoming a MITI show now, for some purpose neither of us can
imagine?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right.&quot; She looked apprehensive for a second,
only a second, and then her eyes hardened. &quot;You know, Noda and Mori claim
I'm Fujiwara ... on my mother's side naturally.&quot; She laughed. &quot;And
you know something else? I feel in my bones that it's true. I believe it. I'm
Japanese, Matthew, and I'm proud of that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I glanced over at a set of samurai armor stationed just
outside the bathroom door, glistening enameled steel. '&quot;Tell you the
truth, I'm second to nobody when it comes to admiring </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s ethic and their guts. But I tend to draw the line
at 'master race' talk. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't object too strenuously
if they did manage to beat us in a fair contest. Hell, we won round one and
they were remarkably sporting about it. But what I want is to make sure round
two is fought on level ground. No inventing new rules, no rabbit punches or
below-the-belt stuff. That's all I ask.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How about showing me some of those swords you claim you
collect?&quot; She came out with it, just like that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My pleasure. Like nothing better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Besides, it seemed a good time for a change of pace. I
straightened up and headed for the back parlor upstairs, then around the corner
to the sword room, its door now fully repaired from the strange break-in. I
fished out the key and snapped open the lock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Funny thing, but walking around fully dressed / had started
feeling out of place. Maybe it is merely a state of mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All right now, where to start? This was a crucial moment. My
first impulse was to go all the way to gold, that marvelous <i>katana </i>dating
from the early </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Kamakura</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, or even before, said to have come
from the forge of the Shogun Yoritomo Minamoto's personal swordsmith. But wait
a minute. After that, what? Maybe the absolute tops should be saved for a more
auspicious moment. That sword was, to my mind, an almost sacred work. Maybe
instead we ought to start with something a little offbeat, then gradually work
up to the best and sharpest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The obvious choice, in fact, was a piece I considered a real
curiosity, racked there on the left, top slot. As I lifted it off and slipped
it out of its scabbard, the metal glistened like a mirror, reminding me how
long it's been since I'd oiled and pampered my playthings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm afraid nothing here was handed down by the Sun
Goddess.&quot; I was coming back down the stairs a little unsteadily, like a
half-drunk samurai. &quot;But this one's kind of like the old style, at least
the metallurgy is. Unusual. Heavy on copper and tin. In a way almost closer to
bronze than steel.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I proceeded to point out a few interesting features—the
nice curve of the face line, the burl grain, the Shinto deities on the
elliptical <i>tsuba</i> hand guard, that kind of thing— taking care to keep it
out of the damned bubbles. I was starting to get wound up, as all enthusiasts
do with a captive audience, when she tactfully cut me off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How's the handle attached, or the grip, or whatever
it's called?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the hilt, the <i>tsuka</i>. Held on with a
little wooden peg stuck through a hole in the metal. Here, let me show
you.&quot; I had a small brass punch on my key ring that was specially designed
to push it out. &quot;Under the grip there's a wrapping of silk braid, and then
a layer of the belly skin of a stingray, to protect the steel. But you just
remove this peg and the whole ensemble slides right off.&quot; I removed the
handle and laid it on the sink. &quot;Now you can see the untempered end of the
sword, the tang or <i>nakago </i>as it's called.&quot; I passed the weapon to
her, blunt end first. &quot;That's where a swordsmith engraved his signature,
his title, the place it was forged. So you always should check. On a really
important piece, there may be cutting tests noted there. Like maybe they tried
out the blade on a criminal or two just to see if it worked. Quality
control.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;God.&quot; She shuddered. &quot;Really?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Licensed testers did it and certified it in gold
engraving on the nakago. Some of the ones upstairs have it. But this one's an
ubu, virgin.&quot; I watched her turn it in the dim light. &quot;Careful now.
That edge is very sharp.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How can you tell if it's really old?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Lots of ways. The grain, the signature, and then too a
good one should have some rust there on the <i>nakago</i>, black not red.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>She held it up a second and examined it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Virgin, huh? No signature?&quot; She had a funny,
almost embarrassed, expression on her face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Correct. But like I said, this one's not—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then who was 'Nihon Steelworks: </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Nagoya</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'? Somebody you bought it from?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Anybody ever tell you you've got a crummy sense of
humor.&quot; I wasn't smiling as I reached to take it back. Her crack annoyed
me and I'm afraid I showed it. Some things you don't kid around about.
&quot;That's a modern foundry that turns out crappy—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't get testy. I'm only reading. Right there.&quot; She
pointed to some very faint English engraved into the metal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Christ</i>!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I grabbed it back and held it under the light to look. No
mistaking. There it was, plain as could be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's when I finally realized the thing was a copy. A goddam
replica of the original. Okay, a remarkably good one, but a fake nonetheless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How did this get in my closet?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Could somebody have broken in and . . . ?</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Suddenly it hit me. The robbery. Whoever had lifted
my records must have also pulled a switcheroo on this <i>katana</i>, leaving this
piece of Nagoya junk and disguising the deed by replacing the original grip and
tsuba hand guard. I'd been too loaded to notice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I wanted to crack the goddam fraud over my knee like in the
movies, but you don't do that with a samurai sword, even a phony modern one. So
instead I flung it down on Jo's Italian-marble floor and headed back upstairs
to check the others. What in hell had happened? Had they cleaned me out after
all. My God, thousands . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I began yanking down swords, starting with the aforementioned
centerpiece of the collection, scrutinizing them in the light. But after about
half a dozen proved to be all right, I started calming down. Nothing else
seemed to have been touched. Well, what the heck, I thought. It wasn't exactly
a crippling loss. Finally I grew a little ashamed of myself and sheepishly
wandered back down, collecting the ringer off the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, I'm sorry. Somebody broke in a while back, and
they must have stuck this fraud in my collection. It's not the one I thought it
was.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sure.&quot; She just looked at me, with some sympathy.
&quot;Matthew, it's all right. Really. Lots of people own replicas of art. I
have a few prints myself. It's not a crime.&quot; She touched my hand.
&quot;Don't worry. It doesn't matter—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You—&quot; I bit my tongue to squelch the unpleasant
word forming on my lips, stomped back upstairs, and returned with a real sword.
Then I gave my lecture all over again, dwelling on every insignificant detail.
I was going to bore the woman till she cried uncle. Finally I succeeded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, you win. I apologize.&quot; She leaned back in
the bubbles. &quot;You really love this hardware, don't you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, I love the samurai ideals. I admire craftsmanship.
I revere courage. The guys who made and used these blades had it all. If I'm
going to collect art, why not something that inspires me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She just looked at me and nodded. I think she really
understood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then let's make a pact, Matt, you and me.&quot; She
finally spoke up. &quot;We'll face Dai Nippon or MITI or whomever honorably.
And we'll keep them honest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Samurai.&quot; I smiled. &quot;Lineage to lineage. And
may the best . . . person win.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I returned the sword and locked up, then lounged in the
bedroom and chatted through the open door while she finished her soak. It
didn't seem proper to lug a chair into the bath, and there was something too
undignified about perching atop the loo. Why, I kept wondering, had somebody
taken such elaborate pains to lift a single antique and plant a fake? So I
wouldn't miss it? But why bother?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally she got into a robe and came out, whereupon we went
downstairs and proceeded to put away more brandy, sleet slamming against the
windows. That was when she refreshed my recollections of her early life, the
peripatetic half-breed army brat. I think, truth be told, she was currently
about as adrift as I was. She was too wary to admit it; I was too incapable of
touching my own fractured emotions. So we talked around things, saying
everything except that maybe we needed somebody. All the while the storm
outside continued to rage. But once again I was feeling those stirrings that
I'd kept on ice for way too long.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alas, though, it had to end. About </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>one A.M.</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> we geared up. She retrieved her coat; I banked the fire; and
we straggled out into the sleet. After finally managing a cab, we headed
uptown. We'd agreed on the rules; now we were off to face the beast.</span></p>

cutting deals and then going out for a drink with the other side's counsel
after you've both finished impressing your clients by shoving each other
against the wall. You're about to start fooling around with guys who carry
submachine guns. When you wouldn't know what to do with an Uzi if somebody
handed you one. If these boys start shooting, there won't be a lot of polite

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam was leaning against my shoulder, still perfumed from the
bubble bath, and totally relaxed. She seemed to know what she was doing. Or
maybe she didn't want to think about the risk we were taking. As for me, this
Sam Spade number was definitely not part of my legal arsenal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My thoughts, however, kept coming back to her. Tam </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Richardson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> was the first woman I'd felt this
comfortable with for a long, long time. She was a mixture of tough and soft,
and she was smart. What I'd always been looking for. Exit Donna, enter Tam.
Maybe life was going to give me another inning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If we both lived that long.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We'd headed uptown on </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Sixth Avenue</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>, rutted with slush; at </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Fourteenth Street</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> we hung a right, east toward Third. The snowplows were out,
together with the salt machines, while abandoned cars were lodged in furrows of
ice all along the curb. This was definitely shaping up as the storm of the
year. Since most of Tanaka's staff lived in the Japanese &quot;ghetto&quot; up
in Hartsdale and Eastchester (where there's even a Japanese PTA these days),
they surely must have caught the &quot;Orient Express&quot; out of Grand
Central before the trains got stopped dead by the weather. Certainly tonight of
all nights the DNI offices would be empty. This had to be our shot. So shape
up, Walton, and go for it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While we listened to the sleet bounce off the back window,
our Jamaican driver proceeded to compare New York City unfavorably with every
armpit he'd ever known, as well as a few arctic locales he doubtless was
acquainted with only by reputation. I finally tuned him out and began asking
myself one question over and over. What exactly are we going to do if we figure
out there's some kind of skullduggery afoot? Is there any way to stop them,
even if we wanted to?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Probably nothing short of Congress's cracking down could keep
Noda's money out of the country, and who's going to support that kind of
legislation? Most solons, in fact, were hailing DNI and its Japanese billions
as the salvation of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. No lawmaker was staring at the
cameras and &quot;viewing with concern&quot; this new godsend of cash. Ditto
the stock exchange. They were nervous downtown, sure, but given the avowed
purpose of Wall Street—attracting money—there wasn't exactly a groundswell of
sentiment against Dai Nippon's massive investments. Noda had come into the
market at its darkest moment and begun shoveling in capital. How could this be
anything but positive? So every time another Japanese billion rolled in and
prices ticked up some more, everybody merely leapt for joy. The Japanese were
coming to rejuvenate our land, cheered the Journal. Billions from the cash-rich
Japanese capital markets were voting with their feet to be part of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s resurgence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe they're right, I told myself. About the only discordant
voices in this chorus of hesitant hallelujahs belonged to a few   op-ed
sour-grape academics. I recalled one piece in particular from late last week.
Who was it: Robert Reich, Lester Thurow, &quot;Adam Smith&quot;?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This must be how it felt all those years in </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Europe</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> as they helplessly watched the invasion of American
money. Has the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> now joined the </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Third World</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, capitalized by rich
&quot;Yankees&quot; from the East? Now at last we realize that setting up
plants here for &quot;co-production&quot; was merely the foot in the door. Does
it matter if </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> industry is owned by American
pension funds or Japanese insurance companies? Guess not, unless you happen to
care whether we still control our own destiny. </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>, soon to be the wholly owned subsidiary . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The writer was just blowing smoke and knew it. These days a
harangue in the Times and a token will get you on the subway. Even </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> was taking a new look at Noda—
astounded by his market savvy. The Georgia po' boy who once summarized his own
trading style as the four F's (&quot;find 'em, fleece 'em, fuck 'em, and forget
'em&quot;) had met his match. What a play Noda had made! To Bill, my new client
had acquired the aura of some omnipotent invader from the depths of space—The
Creature That Ate Wall Street. His eyes glazed over whenever he reflected on
Noda's masterful one-two punch. Billions skimmed inside a week.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, take a good, long look.&quot; I was pointing up
into the night as we emerged onto the slippery sidewalk. &quot;The house that
Noda built. Did all of this happen since only late September?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Time flies when you're having fun.&quot; She slammed
the door and headed for the lobby, calm as could be. Okay, Walton, you'd better
toughen up too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I rewarded our grumbling cabbie with a vulgar tip and watched
the vehicle slowly roll off into the sleet, tires crunching, to end another of
those passing </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> intimacies so vivid yet so
forgettable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As it turned out, lobby security was a breeze, since yours
truly had approved the application of the night guard personally right after
DNI took over. Eddie Mazzola, blue uniform and grasping a Styrofoam cup of
coffee, glanced up from the Sunday Daily News, his face generic </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Staten Island</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What brings you out on a night like this, Mr. Walton?
Nothing wrong, I hope?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do me a favor, Eddie. Burn this place down. We'll split
the insurance and both retire to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Miami Beach</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
Who needs </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He concurred the idea had merit. I then went on to mention
that we'd just come from uptown; Dr. Richardson here had forgotten some kind of
gobbledygook up on twelve, and we wouldn't be a minute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell you the truth, Eddie, my fingers are too damned
numb to bother signing the visitor's book.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He saluted and returned his concentration to the Knicks'
perennial slump.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We took the night elevator up, and somewhere around the time
we passed the ninth floor, we managed to settle on a story. Noda, we would say,
had called Tam and asked her to hurry up a special report on one of the firms
for Monday. We'd just left a dinner party on the </span><span style='font-size:
 10.0pt;color:windowtext'>East Side</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>, thought we'd drop by and pick up some printouts since she
wanted to work at home tomorrow. Shouldn't be more than a minute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the number above the door hit twelve, I tried to remember
how to pray.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the hallway we waved at the TV eye and the steel door
opened. Standing there was Shiro Yamada: cropped hair, trifle burly, gray
uniform. One of the regulars. He shifted his Uzi as we came through. Then he
recognized Tam and bowed low.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By the wildest of good fortune Yamada only spoke Japanese, a
linguistic limitation that turned out to be crucial. Tam began by observing the
niceties: she commiserated with him about the weather, the late hour, would the
next shift be able to get through and relieve him. He was all bows and
deference and <i>hai, hai</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Finally she worked around to why we were there,
almost as though that were a nuisance and the real reason had been to drop by
for a chat. By the way, she added, there were a couple of things she needed
from her office. She gave him the story.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yamada listened, bowing, <i>hai, hai</i>, then sucked in his
breath to demonstrate we'd presented him with a serious conflict of
obligations—which for a Japanese is the most disturbing prospect imaginable.
This situation entails great difficulty, he said, drawing in more air through
his front teeth. <i>Honto ni muzukashii desu</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><i>Muzukashii deshoo ka</i>? Enquired Tam.
Difficulty?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hai, so desu</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. Yes, and he was deeply apologetic. Lots of <i>sumimasen</i>,
very sorry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At first I thought he just hadn't bought the story. But then
it turned out that there were these rules, you see. No one was allowed on the
floor weekends without a pass signed personally by Tanaka-san. He glanced at
his watch. It was nearly </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>two
 A.M.</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> More heavy intakes
of air and <i>muzukashii’s</i>. Of course the honorable Dr. Richardson-san,
being an honorable director herself, should be able to come and go as she
pleased, but the rules . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He seemed to be pleading with </span><span style='font-size:
 10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tarn</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
to help him find a resolution for this towering dilemma.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's the problem, Tam?&quot; I enquired, sotto voce.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No fucking pass.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After an extremely awkward pause a light bulb clicked on in
my simple mind. With great theatrics I suddenly slapped my own forehead, gave
Tam a tip-off in English, and began rummaging my pockets. When we left the
house I'd grabbed an old topcoat, not worn since that rainy night I met Noda,
and in it somewhere was . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She started explaining that Walton-san may have brought the
pass with him and merely let that fact slip his mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I felt what I was looking for, in the bottom of the
inside pocket. Noda's <i>meishi</i>, his business card, complete with the
English note scribbled across the back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How stupid of me,&quot; I apologized. &quot;Had it all
along. Noda- san's 'top priority' pass. He gave it to me only yesterday.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yamada took the business card and studied it with a puzzled
look. What did this have to do with anything?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's when I impatiently turned it over and pointed to the
English scribbling on the back. Noda's initials, I groused, right there at the
bottom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Hai, wakarimasu</i>.&quot; He understood that
Noda-sama surely had written this, but so what? It wasn't the official form
that the rules specified. More <i>muzukashii</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Noda-san was in a rush, I apologized again. Didn't
have time to locate the regular form. Tam passed that along in better Japanese.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Soo desu . . .</i>&quot; Yamada thoughtfully agreed
that such oversights sometimes happened. Everybody knew the big <i>daimyo </i>had
a tendency to override official channels. He shifted his Uzi uncertainly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Noda-sama insisted I finish this report by
Monday,&quot; Tam stressed. &quot;We should only be a minute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yamada scrutinized the back of the card a moment longer,
holding it up to the light. What was he going to do?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally he handed it back, bowed reluctantly, and looked the
other way. It was a go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;God, that was close.&quot; Tam closed the door behind
us and clicked on the lights. &quot;You don't know how lucky we were. If
Morikawa had been on duty tonight, forget it. He'd never have bought that
cock-and-bull routine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>About a dozen computer workstations had been installed</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>on twelve to
link up with the mainframe and data center on eleven. As we moved quickly past
the sleeping screens, blind eyes staring vacantly into space, there was an
eerie, ghostlike abandonment to the place, all the more so because of its
hectic motion during regular hours. The phantoms of regimented analysts seemed
to haunt the rows of empty desks. Tam remarked she'd never seen it like this:
the nerve center off duty. Only the storm of the decade, together with </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>two A.M.</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> Sunday morning, could create such solitude. It took
God to shut down Dai Nippon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, time to move fast. Let's hit Mori's lair.&quot; I
was whispering as we neared the corner office. Ahead was the closed door, solid
oak. I took a deep breath and reached for the knob.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was locked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No dice.&quot; I looked around at Tam, who was still
wearing her lamb coat, gray against her dark hair, sleet melting on the
shoulders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me try.&quot; She gave it a twist. Nothing. &quot;I
don't suppose we'd be very smart just to kick it in. Though that's what I feel
like right now, after all our trouble.&quot; She turned to me. &quot;Maybe
there's a key somewhere in Noda's office? Think there's a chance?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Could be.&quot; I was rummaging my pockets.
&quot;First, though, let me check something.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I pulled out a ring and began to flip through it. &quot;I
ended up with a master, courtesy of the RM&amp;S floor manager that day they
turned in their keys. Now, if this internal door lock hasn't been changed yet,
maybe . . .&quot;I selected one and kissed it for luck. &quot;Here goes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The key, a large silver model, was resistant, the way masters
always are. Undeterred, I wiggled it forcefully, and slowly it slipped into the
knob. A couple of jiggles more and the thing began to revolve under my hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We emitted matching sighs of relief as Tam shoved the door
wide and reached for the light switch. &quot;Now I've got to regress into the
past. A lot of their reports are in Japanese.&quot; She went on to explain that
although she could read the <i>kana </i>syllabaries easily enough, she'd
forgotten a lot of the <i>kanji</i> ideograms. She could piece together enough
to work through a simple newspaper story, but heavy technical prose was always
tough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She quickly sorted through the papers piled in neat stacks</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>atop Mori's
desk, but who knew what most of them said? Nothing looked like my stolen list.
Next she checked the drawers of the desk. One contained a heavily marked
printout; the others, nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Time was ticking. If Yamada decided to make the rounds, no
quantity of creative fiction would save us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She quickly grabbed the printout. At least we had one item
that might give us something. What, though, we still weren't sure. Nothing
resembled the page I'd lifted, but locating that document now appeared
increasingly like a long shot anyhow. Guess everything seems easy till you
actually try doing it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where else to look?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I glanced around the room, wondering about the file cabinet.
Probably locked, and besides . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's when I saw it. On a side table next to some technical
books was an item we'd both failed entirely to notice. A large leather attache
case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, I think we've hit pay dirt. Check that out. Do you
suppose she could have forgotten it last night when they shut the place
down?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe she didn't need it. Anything's possible. I
remember seeing her carrying it around yesterday afternoon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, could be this is our find.&quot; I lifted it . .
. and realized it was empty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shit.&quot; I slammed it down, and just then detected a
faint rattle inside. Hold on a minute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I carefully shook it again and listened. &quot;Tam, there's
something in here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I vote we take a peek.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which is what we did. No harm, right? I mean, the darned
thing was just lying there. No &quot;break and entry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Guess what was inside. Not paper. Not a MITI report. Not
lunch. Nothing in fact except for a shiny little compact disk, a CD.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What the hell is this doing in here? Did she bring
along some Beach Boys?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, that's an optical disk, a CD-ROM.&quot; She
suddenly seemed very pleased.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Compact disk, read-only memory. Except this one looks
to be erasable and writable. This is the latest thing in computer storage
technology.&quot; She held it up to the light, which reflected a rainbow of
colors off its iridescent surface. &quot;Maybe we've found what we came for.
Let's take it and go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is this like the CDs in record stores? The ones you
play back using some kind of laser gizmo?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Same technology, only this is for text and data, not
music. These can hold five-hundred megabytes, about one hundred and fifty
thousand pages.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I have some disquieting information to impart. I
saw somebody come in here one day after shopping at Tower Records, and a CD
he'd bought tripped the metal detector out there in Yamada's anteroom like he
was wearing sleigh bells. Down inside this shiny plastic must be aluminum or
something. We can't take it out.&quot; I turned it in my hand. &quot;And
besides, what would we do with it anyway? Stick it in a Walkman and listen to
all the little digits spin by? In hi-fi?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've got a reader at home . . . but wait, there's a
better way.&quot; She lifted it from my grasp and headed out onto the floor.
&quot;Ever hear of computer crime?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In passing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good. Then what you're about to witness won't shock
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I watched as she kicked on one of the NEC desk stations and
loaded in a program. Next she walked over, flipped a switch on a little box,
and a drawer glided out. In went Mori's shiny disk. Another button was pushed,
the drawer receded, and the disk was spinning silently.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, I thought. You want peaches, you shake the tree, right?
Maybe she's about to kick hell out of the orchard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm going to dump this into the memory of the mother
ship downstairs.&quot; She did some fiddling, then typed in her password to
sign on the mainframe on eleven. &quot;Beam us down, Scottie.&quot; In moments
she and all those silicon cells below us were beeping away at each other. She
didn't look up, just kept typing away, the hollow click-clack that's become the
signature sound of our computer age. Finally she leaned back and breathed. &quot;Okay,
it's reading the disk. After it's in memory down there, we can pull up the
contents here on the screen and see what we've got.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I don't know how long it took to read the thing. Probably no
more than a minute or so, though it seemed forever. Finally something flashed
on the screen and told us the disk had been dumped. Tam took it out of its
little player and passed it to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Here, put this back in her case. While I start pulling
up the file.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd just finished snapping it shut when I heard an expletive
from out on the floor that would not be judged suitable for family audiences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Watch your language.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was sitting there staring at the screen. Finally she
turned and looked at me. &quot;So close, yet so far. It's encrypted'.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's what?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come and look.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I did. On the screen was a mass of numeric garbage. What was
this all about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, when this disk was written, whatever went on it
was scrambled using some key, probably the DES system, the 'data-encryption
standard.' It keeps unauthorized intruders like us from snooping.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How does anybody read it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A decrypting key must be in the hardware down on
eleven. But we can't get through to that level of the machine without an
'access code.' Which we don't have.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very smart. The electronic keys to the kingdom.&quot; I
watched, wondering all the while what Yamada was doing out there. Should I
blunder out and chat him up with my Berlitz Japanese, just to keep him
occupied? The clock above the door was ticking away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, why not just try activating the key using your own
password as the access code? Maybe it'll get you into that level on the
mainframe.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She gave it a go, without much enthusiasm. Predictably the
message came back, 'ACCESS CODE NOT RECOGNIZED.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, try some others.&quot; I was grasping. &quot;Hit
it with 'NODA' or 'MORI.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She did, but after both were rejected the workstation
suddenly signed off. Click, out of the system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's happened now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;More bad news. I forgot the mainframe is programmed so
that you get three tries at a protected code and then it breaks the connection.
That's to keep crackers like us from sitting here all day and running passwords
at random. Another security precaution.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Three chances to guess the secret word and then you're</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>out. Sounds
like a game show.&quot; I just stood there and scratched my head. Seemed we
were, to be blunt, shit out of luck. &quot;What now, Professor? I assume there
are about a hundred million alphanumeric combinations they could use.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Close.&quot; She was clicking away at the keyboard.
&quot;So let's think a minute.&quot; She glanced back at me. &quot;Why don't we
assume for a minute that this is a MITI disk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Safe bet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So the decryptor key in the machine here would be from
MITI, right, since Mori obviously brought the disk to be read?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sounds good.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, I was in Ken's office once, and I recall
watching some of his staff playing around with the information on one of these
disks. Don't know why I still remember this, but the password they used was ...
I think MX something, three letters, followed by six digits. The digits were
always changing, but the prefix was the same.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So if your wild guess about this being a MITI disk is
right, and the first two letters of the three-letter alpha part are still MX,
that means there are exactly, what—twenty-six letters in the alphabet times a
million numbers—twenty-six million combinations. We're looking for one number
in twenty-six million? So if it takes, say, five seconds to type one in and try
it, we're talking roughly a hundred and thirty million seconds to go the
course.&quot; I glanced again at the door. &quot;Besides which, we get kicked
off after every third try. Working around the clock, we ought to have it
sometime about, what, 2001?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She glanced back at the screen, then suddenly whirled around,
a funny look on her face. &quot;What do you have in your office?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't you have a PC downtown?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just a little IBM AT, 512K. And also a Mac, a toy I use
to draw cutsey-poo pictures now and then and do covers for reports.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How about a telephone modem?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Built in. How else could I handle all that trading?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And it's up?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The IBM? Never turn it off. Little twitch left over
from playing the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Hong
 Kong</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> exchanges. Habits
die hard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, I'm going to try and use it to crack the code in
DNI's mainframe.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Honestly, for a second there I thought my hearing had gone.
&quot;My little IBM against that monster? How, forchrissake? There're
twenty-six million—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'll have to do something not very nice. Since the
Japanese aren't used to hackers, those bearded malcontents in firms who screw
up business computers for spite, these workstations aren't buffered off
sensitive parts of the system. We are now going to exploit that trust in
Japanese culture. We're going to organize these terminals, hook them to your
computer, and then direct that network against the mainframe downstairs.
Something no Japanese would ever dream of doing.&quot; She got up and went down
the row clicking on machines. &quot;There's a list of names in my office, there
by the phone. Can you bring it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Coming up.&quot; I fetched it. It was a temporary
&quot;phone book&quot; of the staff on the floor. She took the list and went
back down the line of stations, typing something on each keyboard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you doing, Tam? This is crazy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It'll just take a second. Everybody here has a password
to sign on to the mainframe, but it's just the name of the person.&quot; She
came back to the first workstation. &quot;Now the mainframe thinks ten people
just signed on to the system. We'll use these terminals to try access codes on
the main computer. Your PC will control them so that each terminal hits it with
two codes and then the next one goes on line. That way we'll never get kicked
off. It should get around the 'three times and you're out' filter
downstairs.&quot; She began frantically typing again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you doing now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We could try alphanumerics sequentially or randomly. I
think randomly is probably better. It'll be faster. So I'm writing a little
program for the mainframe, a random-number generator. It'll start making up
random access codes of MX followed by a letter and six digits and sending them to
your PC downtown, which will immediately feed them back in pairs to these
terminals. Out one door, in another. Maybe that will fool it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Christ, woman, you've got a criminal mind. Is this the
kind of stuff you teach at NYU?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's your number downtown?&quot; She was typing away
again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I wrote it down and handed it to her. &quot;I don't have the
foggiest idea how you're going to be able to swing this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's all right. I do. Just let me get your IBM
networked into these terminals here. Fortunately it's compatible, and all it's
going to be doing for now is bouncing back numbers generated by the
mainframe.&quot; She flipped some switches, then typed my number onto the
screen. I momentarily wondered if the sleet had knocked out the phone system.
It hadn't.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Again the seconds crawled by, but as soon as she'd finished
her chat with my IBM downtown, the row of terminals suddenly started beeping
away. Two shots, beep, the next one came alive; two shots, beep, right down the
row.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, your computer is running the show now. Sooner or
later maybe something will click.&quot; She punched a couple more keys, then
got up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's done?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ready to rock and roll.&quot; She was putting on her
coat. &quot;We'll be running millions of numbers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Isn't anybody going to know you've pulled this?&quot; I
was, I confess, totally dumbfounded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not unless they discover my little program in the
mainframe downstairs. But it's just a random-number generator, something any
sophomore could write. The trick is, we're hitting it with so many terminals it
won't be programmed to keep track of all these little elves trying to sneak in.
And when we're through we'll turn them all off using your modem downtown.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good God, whatever happened to pen and pencil?&quot; I
was still dazed. She'd done it all so fast. &quot;If you can find the decryptor
key and get into the files, then what? You going to dump all the info on Mori's
sexy little CD down at my place?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I hope you've got lots of paper. Who knows what's on
it.&quot; She was shutting off the lights. &quot;Come on, let's get out of
here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Aye, aye, Professor.&quot; I walked back, clicked off
the light in Mori's office, then paused to double-check the lock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We came for printouts, remember. We only have
Mori's.&quot; I was joining her. She glanced at the stack on her desk, then
grabbed a pile and handed them to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'd better carry these. And don't be put off by my
'ugly American' routine at the door. It'll be for a purpose.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After she'd doused the rest of the overheads, we passed</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>through the
first security door and greeted Yamada. While I fiddled with Tam's printouts,
she proceeded to give him a very Japanese-style dressing down, disguised as a
series of pale compliments. She reviewed all her work for Dai Nippon, just
happening to mention Noda-sama this and Noda-sama that every other breath. The
hapless guy sucked in his breath and bowed a lot and <i>hai, so</i>-ed about
once a second and then <i>sumimasen</i>-ed some more. By the time the elevator
appeared, she'd destroyed him. He'd lost so much face he'd never dare mention
our visit to Noda or anybody.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>About two minutes later we were out on the sleet-covered
sidewalk, looking for a cab. It was a heroic effort, but eventually we were
headed back downtown. Secure and holding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Although my upstairs office was freezing, I was mesmerized
watching the flashing green numbers spin on my little IBM screen. It was like
playing one of those &quot;fruit machines&quot; at the local bars, except we
were sitting there witnessing a gigantic intelligence turned against itself,
searching for the crack in its own armor. There was something ironic about the
fact that the Japanese were such a homogenous, disciplined people they didn't
need vast arrays of American-style safeguards to keep crazies off their
computers. Unfortunately for them, they weren't expecting a couple of American
criminals with no such scruples.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>four
 A.M.</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> we had watched
three million random numbers tried; by first light we were up to six.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, I'm beginning to get this sinking feeling MITI
must have changed the prefix.&quot; I was bringing a new pot of coffee, half
staggering up the carpeted stairs. &quot;Or maybe we should have done it
sequentially.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe, but that would mean wasting a lot of time on
numbers that are improbable. This is our best chance.&quot; She poured another
cup of java while I just stretched out on the floor. &quot;Damn. I wish I could
remember what the other alpha was. MX what? That could save us days.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We don't have days.&quot; I closed my eyes. &quot;Try
hypnosis.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She sat staring at the screen for a few moments, then slowly
wheeled around. &quot;I know why I couldn't remember it. It was a repeat. Matt,
it was X.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Go with it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hang on.&quot; She did some quick typing and hit the
play</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>button. Her
face was showing the strain, but I loved her looks. What a champ. We were

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At seven-thirty Ben roused himself and lumbered expectantly
up the stairs. With a silent curse I put on my boots and took him out for a

crash. Come on, this was insane, a billion-to-one shot and we didn't even know
what the prize was at the bottom of the box. We were getting nowhere. MITI had
changed the code and screwed us. Fortunately, however, I heroically vowed to

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

down?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

wasn't all that heartbroken to have the place to herself for the afternoon. He
grabbed his coat and said don't throw out The Week in Review.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The streets were now at a standstill, so the prospect of
finding, let alone traveling in, a taxi was implausible in the extreme. As a

looking as if I'd just stumbled in from a three-day forced march. Without a
word he passed over his coat, then followed me downstairs where Tam was still
going through the line of printouts spread across the dining room table,
translating onto one of my yellow legal pads.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jack, that's small potatoes.&quot; I straddled one of
the dining room chairs. &quot;What would you say to a possible play by our
friend Matsuo Noda that makes </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Pearl
 Harbor</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> look like a
gesture of Japanese-American solidarity?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

controlled substance. Now, I'm not so sure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, we're still piecing it together. I don't think
anybody could even imagine what's really afoot. One thing's for sure,
though—this is big.&quot; I paused. &quot;It might even be that Noda is somehow
fronting for MITI, though I'm still not totally convinced.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd been turning that possibility over, but I somehow
couldn't buy it all the way. Wasn't Matsuo Noda's style. He was a loner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Listen. All Noda's talk about helping American
industry? Of course it's bullshit. But I think it's just half the bullshit.
What we suspect is, he's buying a little of everything so nobody will figure
out their real agenda.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

turntable. Mendelssohn was still on the platter. Maybe we were taking too many
precautions, but she still nursed the idea we might be bugged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With the music cranked up to &quot;8,&quot; we proceeded to
give Jack a quick summary of how the stack of memos on the table had come into

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jack, nothing here is spelled out in detail. We have to
take everything and sort of rotate it by ninety degrees to see how Noda fits
in.&quot; I walked over to the table. &quot;Tam, where's your translation of
that one by what's-his-name . . . Ikeda?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

the background.&quot;</span></p>

color:windowtext'>World dominance in semiconductors will provide the basis for
Japan's control of the global information industry by the turn of the century,
which will be the key to our economic leadership and military strength. The
critical path to achieving this lies with the coming generations of
semiconductor technology—the submicron, giga-scale superchip. Accordingly, the
objectives of Operation Market- share - 90 in the semiconductor sector should
receive the highest possible priority. Areas of research should include
semiconductor-grade polysilicon, silicon wafer production, ceramic packaging,
quartz photomasks, X-ray lithography, supercooled Josephson junction circuits,
and optoelectronic chips for optical switching. R&amp;D should also be focused
on digital signal processing, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs),
specialized dynamic random access memories (DRAMs), very large-scale

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Walton, I can't make heads or tails of this
gobbledygook.&quot; He tossed down the sheet. &quot;What's this all
about?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;What it means&quot;—Tam spoke up—&quot;is that
Ikeda has targeted every emerging area of semiconductor research. Everything. A
clean sweep. If he succeeds, sooner or later nobody else will even be able to
make the really advanced chips. A few more years and America joins the Third
World.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jack looked a little skeptical. Truthfully I found her
extrapolation somewhat fanciful myself. But then, who knew?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

color:windowtext'>This office has now completed its review of the recent survey
of research and development (R&amp;D) by Japanese firms compiled by the Science

Of the companies surveyed, 70% maintain that their research is equal or
superior to that of leading firms in the U.S. and Europe, although only 18.2%
consider themselves in unchallenged top position. Furthermore, the remaining

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Whoever wrote this is just
poor-mouthing.&quot; He flipped on through the sheets, then looked up.
&quot;Saying he needs more money for basic research. I hear this kind of stuff
all the time. Hell, Japan already spends nearly twice what we do per capita on
nonmilitary R&amp;D. What does he want?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Keep reading, Jack, and you'll see that the main
R&amp;D he's pushing is in computers and semiconductors. It ties in exactly
with Ikeda's targets. This is backup consensus for the big drive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You still haven't told me anything I didn't already
suspect.&quot; He tossed the pages onto a side table. &quot;So how about
answering a few less-obvious questions?&quot; &quot;Shoot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;First off, what's this Operation Marketshare - 90 all
about?&quot; He took off his glasses and pocketed them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jack, remember the famous Hitachi directive that got
loose a while back, the one on how to market their 256K memory chips, ordering
their salesmen just to keep underpricing American manufacturers till they had
the sale, loss no object. According to Henderson, by the time the International
Trade Commission got around to convicting them of dumping, they'd demolished
America's domestic industry and nailed down ninety percent of the market.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ninety, you say. Well, that's getting to be a familiar
number.&quot; He slumped back against the sofa. &quot;Out of curiosity, what's
included in this MITI Marketshare - 90 operation?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Computers, of course. But also pretty much everything
in high tech where the U.S. still has a leading position—from biotech to
aerospace. These guys don't think small.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I gave Ben a pat, then pulled Mori's printout around, going
on to explain that we'd come across it in the drawer of her desk. It was, I
added, obviously some kind of special computer sorting of the firms DNI was
targeting. The categories in the sort were a breakdown of high-tech areas, with
individual firms listed underneath, together with a summary of their research
expenditures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Take a look. First, notice that this printout has been
sorted and converted into this list here.&quot; I placed it alongside the page
I'd found in the Xerox machine. &quot;Voila, they're identical.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, now compare that list with the R&amp;D areas
targeted in Ikeda's memo.&quot; I laid Tarn's translation down next to Mori's
pages. &quot;See? Everything on Ikeda's MITI wish list for research in
semiconductors is now being done by the American outfits named here in Mori's
sorting, which is the latest revision in DNI's acquisition program.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you getting at?&quot; He looked it over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's a pattern.&quot; Tam spoke up. &quot;These new
buy-ups cover Japan's last remaining shortfalls in R&amp;D. I spotted it right
away. But what I didn't realize till we got these memos was that the areas
covered by Mori's companies exactly dovetail with MITI's goals. I probably wouldn't
have noticed it without her sorting. Mixed in with all the other companies
Noda's buying, he's targeted those that fill the gaps in MlTI's semiconductor
push.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jack looked at us quizzically. &quot;Are you telling me
MITI's behind Noda's program?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's where Tam and I parted company. She argued it was
obviously a MITI play: why start from scratch when you can just buy what you
need? Sound business investment. For some reason, though, I wasn't so sure.
Somehow that explanation seemed too simplistic. Unfortunately, however, there's
a law in science or somewhere that says you should always pick the
least-complicated theory that fits all your data. Hers appeared on the face of
it to address the facts perfectly. Except for one unknown: if Mori did
&quot;accidentally&quot; feed me the sorting that blew the whistle on Noda's
design, why?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think this has to be what the buying program on this
list is all about,&quot; Tam answered. &quot;He's taking over firms whose
R&amp;D coincides with MITI's targets. Matsuo Noda has been put to work simply
acquiring what they need, but to make sure nobody suspects the real agenda,
he's worked up this elaborate 'management assistance' story, buying all kinds
of companies.&quot; Her voice was bitter. &quot;The next step will be to set up
joint ventures between these firms he's bought and their counterparts in Japan.
Then all American R&amp;D would be shared.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Which means&quot;—Jack's face began to
redden—&quot;that since we always seem to lose out when it comes to
commercializing what we invent, the U.S. ends up becoming one big think tank
for Japan in the twenty-first century. We do the research, and they manufacture
and market. They pick our brains and then cash in on it.&quot; He turned back
to Tam. &quot;Do you really think it was Noda who planned all this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I wish I knew what to think.&quot; Her voice grew
hesitant as she continued to stare down at the memo. &quot;It's hard to believe
Ken would do something so unethical—especially a grab like this—when I'm sure
he's convinced Japan ought to be advancing its own R&amp;D.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken? Who's—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did you see who authored that second memo?&quot; She
pointed to the name.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kenji Asano is apparently a close friend of Dr.
Richardson's,&quot; I broke in, my tone unnecessarily sharp.
&quot;Unfortunately, he seems to be an even closer friend of his cronies at
MITI.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam didn't respond, just sat there looking betrayed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, let's be constructive here.&quot; Jack walked
over and shook the coffee pot, then sloshed the last dregs into his cup.
&quot;We damn well ought to take some kind of action.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's why we wanted to talk to you.&quot; Tam came
back to life. &quot;Do you think you could leak something about this? Maybe to
the Times?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And say what?&quot; He laughed, a little sadly.
&quot;That I've happened across a set of secret MITI memos that bear a
coincidental similarity to some stolen DNI printout? Don't think that's exactly
'Fit to Print.'&quot; He frowned. &quot;But I'm glad our Mr. Noda has finally
let slip his true intentions. I never believed all that pious malarkey about
propping up American industry.&quot; He snorted. &quot;The man gets a few suckers
like you to help him destabilize our bond markets, in the process of which he
turns the high-tech sector of American industry into a bargain basement for
MITI.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam sipped her coffee, maybe trying to act as if Jack's
comment hadn't stung her the way I suspected it did. I decided to try and
handle her defense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jack, hold on a second. You've got to admit that a lot
of these outfits Dai Nippon is buying are currently on pretty thin ice. If
somebody doesn't come in here and help run them right, they're probably headed
offshore anyway.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're not talking about first aid now, Walton. We're
talking about Matsuo Noda taking over the most strategic segment of our economy
after pulling the biggest scam in the history of world finance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That looks to be the story.&quot; I watched his cheeks
redden with frustration. &quot;So what do you propose we do? There's no law
against foreign investment. Securities exist to be bought.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, dammit, Matt, we've both seen enough by now to
realize this Noda genius is up to no good. We've got to stop him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Couldn't agree more. So why don't you just arrange to
have the SEC shut down trading in every stock DNI has in its gunsights.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know that's out of the question.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Exactly. So what legal remedies are there? How do you
squelch a takeover program that's not even against the law?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's your specialty, counselor, or so I hear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jack, be realistic. We can expose this thing, maybe
even try and lean on Tokyo to back off, but aside from shutting down trading
there's no legal way to actually stop Matsuo Noda from buying whatever he
likes. You can't shut Japanese investors out of Wall Street. There'd be a riot
downtown. We're talking about the open market here, not some inside deal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Forget legalities.&quot; He scowled. &quot;Tell me how
your damned corporate raiders go about  shenanigans that don't quite match the
letter of the law.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jack, I've officially quit the business. Retired. Guess
you hadn't heard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's what you think. You just got un-retired. As of
this moment. Now give me one of those high-priced consultations you're so
famous for.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;For you, Jack.&quot; I looked him over. &quot;One last
play. Trouble is, there's not much that's do-able, at least on short
notice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You say 'not much.' Which means there's
something.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, one possibility might be to try and slow him down</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>some, make
him think twice, say, by punching up the prices of the stocks he's aiming at.
Make them less of a bargain.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's a start.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not much of one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, how could it be done?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Since you're such a Boy Scout, Jack, you probably won't
like what I have in mind. This one's not exactly in the rule book.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Try me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, it's a long shot, and we'll definitely need some
help. If we're going to tinker with the market, then we have to have somebody
Wall Street trusts. And also somebody who's got a lot of money to play with,
short term.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sounds like our mutual friend from Georgia.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, Henderson can play the Street like a symphony.
What I'm thinking of involves tricking the smartest guys around, the 'risk
arbs.' We'd need to suck them in. If anybody can do it, he's the man.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I say let's give him a buzz.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fine. Why don't I get him on the squawk box so we can
all listen in.&quot; There beside the couch was an old conference phone some
client once gave me as a Hanukkah gift. At long last it might be good for
something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The risk arbs, by the way, are the risk arbitrageurs, those
speculators who live with one ear to the ground. The minute they hear word,
inside or otherwise, that a company is &quot;in play,&quot; meaning it's a
candidate for a possible takeover or merger, they immediately grab up and
stockpile huge blocks of its publicly traded shares. Then they sit back and
pray for a bidding war. Since company A has offered so much a share for company
Z, maybe company B will step in and offer more. Or maybe company Z itself will
outbid them both and offer even more in a stock buyback. They're the hyenas of
the hunt, getting plenty of leftovers no matter who ends up buying Z. Besides,
they don't really care anyway. They're not investing in American industry, they're
laying side bets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam and Jack settled back while I punched in Bill's number.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The doctor was in, and after a few profane formalities—
tempered when we informed him of a female presence—he listened with
uncharacteristic attentiveness. I gave him an</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>update,
concluding with the view that we ought to try heading off MITI's presumed play.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Henderson, despite his admiration for Noda's style, didn't
take kindly to the possible buy-up of America's remaining R&amp;D in
semiconductors, a specter that coincided all too closely to his own fable about
how MITI had already eaten one segment, memory chips. I decided to start by
seeing if he and I were on the same wavelength concerning countermeasures.
Without tipping him to my own idea, I asked what he thought could be done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell you, it won't be easy. One thing, though, we could
maybe try and scare 'em off with a little brushfire.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Try that in English, Bill,&quot; Jack interrupted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't know, maybe a few hot rumors could hit the Street
. . . mergers, takeovers, your usual quick-buck action. Say a few of the CEOs
of these outfits on Noda's Christmas list had a little powwow, a 'secret'
meeting everybody manages to hear about, and supposedly talked about gettin'
themselves bought out. Naturally they'd deny everything on the Evening News,
which in itself will tell the Street we're talkin' wedding bells.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is that really going to do us any good?&quot; Tam was
talking to the box.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Afternoon, ma'am. Liked that last book of yours a whole
lot. Hope you're keeping them boys sober.&quot; I could almost see Henderson
turn up the charm, sculpting a voluptuous, horny divorcee in his ardent
imagination. Tam, to my surprise, was not totally immune to his Georgia sweet
talk. She sort of smiled to herself as he continued, &quot;But to answer your
question, a takeover rumor can do marvels for your stock price. What happens is
the 'arbs' come in, snapping up blocks of stock and holding them, just in case.
It can take a lot of securities out of circulation, at least short term. So if
we could get the arbs to chasing those companies on Noda's list, they'd give
the Japs a little competition. At the very least it'd kite the market, hurt
their pocketbook.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bill, that's why we wanted to call you. How about
putting your finances where your flag-waving is? Be an arb yourself for a few
weeks. Lead the herd. Start picking up some blocks of stock and shooting off
your mouth a lot about your 'inside' information. I'll even kick in my modest
retirement fund to help the action.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What if somebody pulls the rug out from under us?
Shoots the whole thing down? We'd be left holding all that stock we'd bid up.
We could lose our shirt.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then protect the downside by buying puts. I have full
faith you'll think of something. Come on, Henderson, be a market maker. You've
got the credibility. All you have to do is set a spark to this, then we'll
quietly head for the sidelines to make way for all those investment-house
yuppies who love to shoot craps with their clients' money.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have to be a quick in and out for damned sure. This
hot-air balloon won't stay up for long.&quot; He paused, clearly not wild about
the idea. &quot;Tell you what, though, maybe if we had a real good story.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ideas?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, how about this? Maybe we've just heard on the
grapevine that those outfits on Noda's play list have started a little 'white
knight' talking. And since this is just speculation, we might as well think
big. Know who I mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The pride of Armonk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Give that man a gold star. We both know IBM
headquarters ain't talked to nobody but God since Watson outgrew his short
pants, so it'd be weeks before they'd stomp on some horse-pucky rumor about how
they were looking into saving whatever's left of the chip business here. Just
covering their ass, we'll say. Friendly mergers. No poison pill stuff.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's exactly the kind of specious 'supporting detail'
that always triggers the Street's greed.&quot; I concurred. &quot;Offhand I'd
say that sounds just about perfect for tomorrow's hot tip on the Exchange
floor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In truth it did seem like a workable first draft of an idea.
No law against deep background sources that turn out to be 24-carat bullshit
down the road. The antitrust implications would be front page for a couple of
days, but since the administration adhered to the 'see no evil' school of
regulation, that angle wouldn't impress the smart money. America starts
thinking big, chucks the myth of garage entrepreneurs, and staves off Japan
using a dose of MITI's own medicine. IBM rides in to rescue what's left of
Silicon Valley. It might just make Matsuo Noda back away. He'd learn America
could play hardball too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We told Bill to take the rest of the day off. Jack was, I can
report, noticeably encouraged. Tam also. For my own part I just crashed, with a
few wistful reflections on my rocky</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>non-seduction.
But if we pulled off our little scam, she might be more inclined to take me
seriously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Shakespeare said, Lord, what fools these mortals be. I
realized the true extent of Matsuo Noda's reach on Monday, just after noon. I
was still home when Tam called from the office uptown to inform me of the
latest developments. I was so busy on the phone just then, planting merger
rumors with a few friendly columnists, that I was almost annoyed to take time
out for her call. However, she quickly captured my attention.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>First, the revisions on DNI's acquisition program were in
full swing. Noda had started purchasing those healthy semiconductor outfits on
the new list.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she went on to say that an additional set of buy orders
had just gone out over the wire. Noda had been on his satellite hookup to Tokyo
all morning, and he'd now finalized official authorization for a minor
expansion, so to speak, in DNI's program. Apparently Tokyo had agreed with him
that his portfolio should include a certain high-grade issue to achieve better
overall &quot;balance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She didn't say much more, for obvious reasons, but we both
had a strong hunch what must have happened. If anything was bugged, for
chrissake, it wasn't my apartment. That's B-movie stuff. It had to be my phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Matsuo Noda had just kicked off a new buy program to the tune
of three and a half billion. For what? More high-tech stragglers? Not
precisely. One company, and in an amount intended to stay safely just below the
Securities and Exchange Commission's Form 13-D mandatory reporting. Twenty-five
million shares of IBM, roughly a full four percent of Big Blue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was a massive variation of the &quot;Pac-Man&quot;
takeover defense: you eat anybody you think wants to eat you. Noda's message to
us was loud and clear: he could buy the USA anytime he wanted. Dai Nippon was
unstoppable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:1.0pt;color:windowtext'><img
width=33 height=33 src="images/image017.jpg" alt=""></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I hung up the phone very slowly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We've 'moved the shadow.'&quot; I spoke the words to
myself hesitantly, maybe even a little apprehensively. That was the name for a
famous strategy of the seventeenth-century swordsman Miyamoto Mushashi, using a
feint to lure your opponent into prematurely disclosing his battle plan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The way I saw it, Matsuo Noda now stood revealed. It had all
been a setup. The financial scam, the help-American-industry cover, the MITI
&quot;guidance.&quot; This was a takeover, all the way. A global takeover. What
else could it be?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And the only people on this side of the Pacific who knew were
Matt Walton and Tam Richardson.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For some reason that thought brought to mind the professor at
Stanford, the AI guy who'd disappeared. What was it Tam had said? He'd had
dinner at her apartment? Asked her to do something for him in Japan? And her
MITI friend, whose name was all over that stack of memos on the table
downstairs? Asano. Where did he fit in?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One thing, he'd helped Noda recruit her. They'd worked
together, and their play had been flawless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But now our friend Matsuo Noda had a small headache. Tam
Richardson and Matt Walton had exposed the underside of his game. The shadow
had moved. Which meant it would only be a matter of time before he struck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where was our weakness, hers and mine? What would cause us to
lose our rhythm, to blunder? He'd already outmaneuvered Jack O'Donnell with
ease. He had a master swordsman's unerring instinct for his opponent's
weakness. So where was mine? I had to know it before he found it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd realized Jack could be blackmailed, if the stakes were</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>his
constituents' jobs and lives. But I didn't need a job. And the only life . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Of course! It was obvious. Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Could it be I was dealing with a madman who made people
disappear?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If I was about to take on a pro like Noda, I had to cover
every possibility. Which meant I had to get her out, away, beyond his reach.
Today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Still, though, there were so many questions. Who was<sup> </sup>really
behind all the moves, the master puppeteer? Was it only Matsuo Noda, or was
this possibly, just possibly, something that wound its way even higher. If so,
who was the point man on that? Akira Mori?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The only rational countermove now was to back off and
&quot;survey prevailing conditions.&quot; Miyamoto Mushashi's <i>keiki o shiru
to iu koto</i>. But to do that we had to remove ourselves beyond the reach of
Dai Nippon's sword. How long did we have?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I glanced at the clock on my desk, the little Sony digital.
The number 12:18 stared back, the two dots in the middle flashing every second.
Amy was still at school, and for the moment I couldn't think of a safe</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. They wouldn't even let me in
without a pass. She didn't get out till four P.M.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So now what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Simple. In swordsmanship, vigilance is everything. And there
are two things you always have to keep in view. The first is called <i>ken</i>,
the surface actions, the moves your opponent wants you to see. The second, and
more important, is <i>kan</i>, the essence of things, the real truth. <i>Ken </i>covers
the superficial moves; <i>kan </i>gives you the big picture.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Instinctively I still believed we had only been witness to <i>ken</i>,
the distractions, the insignificant feints of our opponent. The deeper wisdom
of <i>kan</i> still lay beyond us. Time to probe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We had three and a half hours.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I got up and headed downstairs to retrieve a couple of very
important memos. If we needed them, we'd have them. The rest of the pile I
brought back upstairs and locked in the sword room (the closest thing I had to
a safe). Finally, I reflected a second and paused to scribble Emma a note,
asking her to feed and walk Ben in case I wasn't around for a while. That taken
care of, I retrieved my heavy topcoat from the front closet, walked out into
the street, and grabbed a cab for the offices of Dai Nippon, International.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe our opening move should be <i>uromekasu to iu koto</i>,
to feint a thrust that would induce a state of confusion in Noda's mind. Then
we could stage a tactical retreat to plan the final, all-out attack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Retreat to where? Well, that part at least was easy: the
obvious hideaway was my place down in the islands. The thing to do was to
quietly catch American 291 and head for the Caribbean. If Noda did manage to
track us down, he'd be in for a surprise. Let me explain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Back when the world was young and Amy was still a gleam in
our eye, Joanna and I acquired a rambling white fortress, complete with pool,
that was being offered to the first tourist appearing on St. Croix that day
with ready cash. Seemed its Cosa Nostra owner back in Sicily (so the story
went) suddenly needed a transfusion of a hundred grand in bail money.
Fortunately I'd had a good year and happened to have the necessary liquidity.
It was luxurious beyond vulgarity. Hardwood parquet floors, heavy tile roof (to
withstand an Interpol bombing run? Who knows?), manicured grounds, satellite
dish, a bar worthy of Caesars Palace, three bedrooms, and music in every room.
It was oversize and garish and pretentious and . . . who cares, I loved the
place. Sort of a Roman villa in the middle of paradise. However, because of the
peculiar requirements of its former tenant, it also had a security setup to
shame Fort Knox, including a six-foot fence, two-inch-thick doors, and TV
monitors all over the grounds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If we could locate a little hardware to match Noda's Uzis,
he'd be in for a surprise should he try and send down a Dai Nippon hit squad
for an unscheduled visit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But first things first. Right now we needed to somehow lure
Matsuo Noda into revealing more of his overall strategy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After the cab dropped me off, I rode the elevator up to
twelve and passed through security. The complement of guards, I noticed in
passing, had just been expanded. Instead of two, now there were four. And when
I walked out onto the floor, nobody said anything, but there was an almost
palpable air of tension. Stony silence, analysts nervous. Bad vibes, very bad
vibes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I just ignored the stares and headed straight for Tarn's
office. She was waiting, and she had an identical reading of the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>situation.
The minute I walked in, she got up and shut the door. Her first words . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He just brought in more security. That, and the IBM
thing. Matt, he's getting worried.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bet your ass he is. We're moving in too close. But I
think Noda figures he's just toying with us now. Having some fun before he cuts
us in half.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not afraid of him. No matter what he tries.&quot;
She glanced at the door. &quot;Did you bring the memos?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Here in my briefcase. But I think it's too soon to show
him everything we have. Right now he doesn't know what we've got. That's better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I've just begun to fight. I'm going to Tokyo to
get the truth out of Ken.&quot; She paused, and her voice trembled slightly
with anger. &quot;He's got some heavy explaining to do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're incredible.&quot; I just looked at her. &quot;I
almost believe you still can't accept that your friend Asano is in on Noda's
play. Since he's such a terrific guy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, I don't believe it. He wouldn't be part of this.
You don't know him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That I don't.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All I'm saying is, this doesn't feel right. He wouldn't
involve MITI in whatever Noda's planning.&quot; She sat down, running her hands
through her tousled dark hair. &quot;You know, the fact is we still don't know
for sure who's really behind what.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Exactly. How does everybody fit in, including us? We've
got pieces of a puzzle lying around—a section here, a section there—but
something fundamental is missing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what do we do next?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How about a little joust with our friend downstairs?
Try and feel him out. Maybe we can lure him into making another move, something
that'll give away more of his game.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You don't think he's actually going to talk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not really. He'll feint, parry. But if we watch
carefully, maybe we'll glimpse more of the outline of his strategy. Then we'll
know what our counter scenario has to be.&quot; I decided to hold off on
telling her the getaway plan. Assuming the walls had ears, we'd already said
too much. &quot;Look, make you a deal. First let's see what happens with Noda,
then we decide what to do about your friend Asano.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right. But let's stay cool.&quot; She was locking
her desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You read my mind.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With that settled, we strolled out, past the doubled
security, and headed down to eleven. The way people looked at us, I felt as
naked as Tam had been in the bath Saturday night. How much did they know?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Matsuo Noda was in his office. His secretary buzzed us right
through, almost as though he'd been waiting for our appearance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Richardson. Mr. Walton.&quot; He rose to greet us.
&quot;How timely. There is an urgent matter we have to discuss.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We want to talk about MITI.&quot; I decided to try and
break his rhythm as quickly as possible. Take the action to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then this is a coincidence.&quot; An easy smile as he
resumed his seat. &quot;That happens to be the very matter I wanted to
explore—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What we want to know,&quot; Tam interrupted, &quot;here
and now, is whether our program is being run by the ministry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Richardson, you . . . and Mr. Walton, are in the
employ of Dai Nippon, International, not MITI.&quot; He leaned back in his
chair. &quot;Though of course nothing in this world is entirely simple. 
Certain . . . interests of the ministry are germane to our programs here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then we'd like to hear about it.&quot; She glanced at
the leather chairs but decided to remain on her feet. I did the same.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His face was like granite. &quot;Well, you are aware we've
occasionally received input from MITI's Industrial Technology arm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How about Research and Planning, Ken's section?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Only a few informal—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing to do with Marketshare - 90?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He betrayed a hint of confusion, quickly masked. &quot;Dr.
Richardson, with all due respect, I fear you may not be entirely aware of the
various forces at play here.&quot; He leaned back. &quot;This program of ours
must succeed. There are many avenues of responsibility, but all difficulties
will be overcome.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All in time, please believe me.&quot; He smiled once
more. &quot;I'll readily grant you our acquisition program may have evolved
slightly as of late in the direction of more-solid securities, but you can be
assured that is merely a response to the concerns of certain conservative institutional
investors in Tokyo.&quot; He continued, a silver tongue to match his silver
hair. &quot;Risk is involved. Not to mention an enormous quantity of funds.
There is pressure on us just now to try and maintain a prudent balance in our
portfolio.&quot; He glanced at his watch impatiently. As if he was anxious to
move ahead. &quot;Which brings us to the matter we have to address.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just to set the record straight&quot;—I decided to do a
little parrying of my own—&quot;you have nothing to say about any kind of MITI
involvement? Including Marketshare - 90?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, this Marketshare - 90 proposition you refer to
probably should be thought of as merely one of the ministry's more ambitious
trial balloons, nothing more. It has the quality of—how do you say
it?—woolgathering. Whatever its purpose, it should in no way be confused with
Dai Nippon's objectives.&quot; Such was Noda's reply. Then in a remarkably
convincing tone he added, &quot;How could the ministry's planning possibly have
anything to do with our program here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam wasn't buying. &quot;Looks to me like it has a lot to do
with</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Richardson, since I am no longer directly
affiliated with MITI, I am not in a position to speak for every proposition
arising there. However, we both know that the ministry's responsibility is to
provide long-range industrial planning. They often circulate scenarios for
comment. It's part of their job.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We were rapidly losing our footing. Noda was top-ranked
swordsman. He'd kept his discipline and revealed nothing. He was telling us we
hadn't found an opening. He was right. It was a classic standoff.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or it should have been. Strategically, we should have taken
that moment to back away and analyze Noda's style, searching for his weakness.
But instead Tam made what turned out to be a fatal move. She struck, exposing
herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Since according to you MITI is not involved in this
program, there should be no problem if I contacted them directly and talked
this over. In Japan.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I wanted to yell no, don't tell him anything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But it was too late.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;An excellent idea.&quot; He nodded gravely, then turned
to me. &quot;Do you intend to be part of this expedition as well, Mr.
Walton?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What to do? The only moves left now were defensive. No way
was I going to let Tam face the beast alone. Also, if Noda had me, he wouldn't
need Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I assume you can spare me here for a few days.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But we will all be in Japan together.&quot; He removed
his thin, wireless spectacles. &quot;That is in fact the very matter I needed
to discuss with you. It is time you both were brought more closely into the
matters at hand. Beginning today. I've already made reservations on New York
Helicopter, departing for Kennedy in two hours. From the East Thirty-fourth
Street heliport.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had us. He'd seized the initiative, feinted us off
balance, and defined the terms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She tried to recover. &quot;When and where we go is something
we intend to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah, Dr. Richardson, one must seize the moment. It is
past time you and Mr. Walton understood more fully the many levels of concern
involved here. There are a number of things you need to see.&quot; He smiled as
he replaced his glasses. &quot;Because of the expected frequency of my travels
in the coming months, I have just leased a Concorde. We refuel in Bahrain. I've
been looking forward to having you both as my guests.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The answer is no.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton, I urge you not to forgo this opportunity
too rashly.&quot; He looked me over. &quot;In fact, since you are known to be
an authority on Japanese arms, I could even arrange for you to have a firsthand
look at the Imperial sword.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Forget it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But the timing couldn't be more ideal. At the moment
the sword has just been transferred to one of the metallurgy labs at Tsukuba
Science City for minor repair work. Since Tsukuba is to be our destination as
well, I can just telex the Imperial Household and instruct them to arrange a
viewing date.&quot; He smiled again. &quot;For a connoisseur such as yourself,
nothing would please me more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was something about the way he said it. I don't know.
Maybe a strange glimmer flashed through his eyes. Looking back, I think that
was the moment I first should have realized Matsuo Noda had decided he was God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You didn't hear me. We're not leaving now. At least not
on your terms.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton, I really must insist.&quot; He glanced over
at Tam. &quot;What I intend to show you should be of extreme interest to you
both.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll go when I'm ready.&quot; She turned and headed for
the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Richardson, I'm afraid we all have no
alternative.&quot; He spoke quietly, his tone masking the harshness as he
continued. &quot;These offices have been sealed. As a temporary security
measure. There appears to have been an unauthorized access to the NEC mainframe
here. However, I've decided to postpone criminal charges for the moment.&quot;
He smiled again. &quot;Besides, the time has come for you both to know
everything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We were on our way. I looked out of the window on my side,
down through the haze covering New York's East River just below us, and took
Tam's hand. The NY chopper was a Sikorski S58T, twin engine, two pilots. Events
were moving so fast it was hard even to think. No doubt about one thing,
though: we'd been outmaneuvered, outplanned, outfought. The only good part was,
he had me as hostage, not Amy. In a final face-off with Noda, whatever he had
in mind, I still figured I could take care of myself, MITI and all. The battle
had just begun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When we walked out of Noda's office, there was no longer any
mistaking the new security arrangements. Dai Nippon was on red alert.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, Matthew, looks like we're about to get the big
picture, like it or not.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;On Noda's terms. Which wasn't the way it was supposed
to happen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I just need to confront Ken.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For whatever good it may do, I found myself thinking. We were
knee-deep in confrontations and we still didn't know a damned thing. What did
Noda have planned for us? Whatever it was, I had a strong feeling I didn't want
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Back in my own office at Dai Nippon, there was only time for
one phone call. The first name that came to mind was Joanna. I wanted to say,
Look, if I don't make it through this, you and Amy are well provided for. She's
got a trust fund that's seven figures, and you can have the house, the bank
account, the whole damn works. Just don't ever let a man named Matsuo Noda
anywhere near you or her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But I couldn't force myself to dial the number. It wasn't
Joanna who was in over her head now; it was me. The subtle or</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>not-so-subtle
difference was enough to stop me cold. I'd vowed to manage life on my own, and
this was no moment to waffle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So, instead I did the next best thing and called The West
Side Free School—which, I might add, may have been free in its disdain for
classical curriculum, but it had very non-free tuition practices. I identified
myself, announced an emergency, and asked to speak to Ms. Amy Walton. In about
a minute she was there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dad, we're in the middle of our Monday Geo-2
exam.&quot; She lowered her voice. &quot;What's the capital of Somalia?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honey, haven't a clue. Just try and do the best you
can. Employ that exceptional brain of yours.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Adults don't have to know the capitals of Third World
countries. That's a small perk we get for putting up with old age.&quot; I
paused. &quot;Amy, about this weekend.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Uh, oh.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Betcha I know what's
next.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, a problem's come up. I've got to take care of a
few things.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dad, the snow leopards. This weekend is when they're
supposed to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honey, we'll hit the Bronx Zoo the minute I get back. I
absolutely promise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You going off somewhere?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just a quick trip.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where?&quot; She perked up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'll talk about it when I get back.&quot; I wanted to
say &quot;if I get back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Big secret, huh?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Amy, I just wanted to . . . darling, be careful.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's the matter? Dad, are you in some kind of
trouble?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How could I answer? Damned right I was, but that wasn't the
point of the call.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sweetie, just . . . just be especially careful. That's
all. I'll try my best to make it up to you at Christmas. Maybe we can still get
down to the islands somehow. And Amy . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I love you, honey.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Love you too, Dad. Look, I gotta get back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm sure Ms. Winters will give you some extra
time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't bet on it. She's an old grouch. She's
twenty-eight and an old maid.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Twenty-eight. Old? Good God. I keep forgetting what it's like
to be thirteen and think of the future as the next three weeks, followed by a
gaping void.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sweetheart, that's not exactly ancient. Believe me.
She's probably still got half a dozen good years left.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell her. Look, I've gotta run.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right. Just advise your mother something unexpected
came up. Maybe you and I can make it next weekend. We'll do the snow leopards,
that's an absolute guarantee.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Great. So long, Dad. Have fun.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I almost said &quot;good-bye.&quot; Bad luck, I thought. So
instead I said, &quot;Take care.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shortly thereafter Matsuo Noda, Tam Richardson, and yours
truly were headed over to New York Helicopter's midtown pad, one of Noda's
bodyguards in the limo with us. The battle was drawn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now as I looked down at the boroughs of New York gliding
below, all those little strings of metallic beads lined up on the ribbons of
asphalt, the backyards of New York's solid middle class glimmering with
remnants of snow, I found myself wondering what Noda had planned for them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Another imponderable still nagged at me as well: what about
Akira Mori? Tam reported that by the time she'd arrived at the DNI offices this
morning our friend had vanished. Ditto her information-packed attache case. As
quickly as the lady had come, she'd disappeared back to Tokyo. But not with
Noda. She'd gone on her own terms. Was he now using his new Concorde to try and
head her off. What had she been doing here? Just hand-delivering MITI's latest &quot;guidance&quot;?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe we were finally about to uncover everybody's real
agenda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Again my mind went back to ken and kan, Miyamoto Musashi's
famous discourse on mental attitude in The Way of the Warrior, which he called <i>heiho
kokoro mochi no koto</i>. What was merely appearances, <i>ken</i>, and what was
<i>kan</i>, the global picture, the essence?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda had temporarily gained the upper hand, but now I
realized that was almost to be expected. After all, he was a swordsman with
decades of experience. So much for <i>ken</i>, my superficial observation. The
real truth, <i>kan</i>, lay much deeper. And like all such truths it had to be
elementary, elegantly simple.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which left only two possibilities. Either Matsuo Noda was
merely an insane genius about to show us the inner workings of the massive
organization he now controlled, or he planned to kill us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or both.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h1><a name=bookmark8><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>CHAPTER TWENTY</span></a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:1.0pt;color:windowtext'><img
width=33 height=33 src="images/image018.jpg" alt=""></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dr. Kenji Asano gazed out the window of his office at the
Institute, the last shafts of sun casting long shadows in the canyons below. It
was late Tuesday afternoon, and gales of December wind tunneled around the
skyscrapers of Tokyo, chilling the gray steel and glass. The blank computer
screens reflected back his smooth, trim face, his glum eyes. Technology. It was
divorcing man from all sensibility. What Kenji Asano found himself wanting at
that moment was not high-tech but high-touch, to be seated on the <i>tatami </i>of
his Tokyo teahouse, smelling the fresh straw, gazing out over the manicured
evergreen shrubs of his garden, the clumps of leafless black bamboo. He recalled
again the tea ceremony in Kyoto and the sight of Tamara approaching down the
stepping stones of the &quot;dewy path.&quot; She was a rare American, one who
understood the essence of <i>cha-no-yu</i>—inner power shows itself in outer
restraint.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As he lit a Peace cigarette with a wooden match and
continued to examine the cheerless skyline of Tokyo, a thought flickered
past—Bodhidharma, the first Zen master, who had plucked away his eyelids to
prevent sleep as he meditated. That reflection led naturally to ruminations on
the master's disciple, Hui-ko, who sat <i>zazen </i>for days in the snows
outside Shao-lin monastery, then finally severed his own arm and offered it to
the master as testament of his devotion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Bushido</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
the code of the samurai. Who today would cut off an arm to prove determination?
Or be Benkei at the Bridge, the servant who breaks the rules of society and
cudgels his own master to protect their disguise and deceive their foes. That
famous episode, he told himself, would be his model. Sometimes <i>bushido </i>required
you to circumvent tradition and honor for the greater good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What was happening in Japan? These days many thoughtful
Japanese were expressing open concern, even fear, over their country's rising
nationalism. Although high officials still couched their flag-waving in coded
language intended to elude foreign notice, many prominent voices were now
suggesting &quot;it's wrong to think prewar Japan was all bad.&quot; The latest
school textbooks spoke glowingly of the country's Imperial traditions.
Encouraged by this jingoism, in truth veiled racism, many superpatriots were
beginning to emerge from obscurity. Now, with the Imperial sword as symbol, the
Japanese right was openly on the march. Surely Noda had known it would happen,
had counted on it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He recalled the line by Yeats, &quot;And what rough beast,
its hour come round at last . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The &quot;beast,&quot; Kenji Asano feared, had arisen in
Japan. And its monstrous head was none other than Matsuo Noda. Who could have
suspected the dark side of Noda's grand design or the extent of his determination?
Violence, money in the billions, and accomplices where they were least
suspected. Perhaps even inside MITI.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This last disturbing prospect had convinced Kenji Asano that
the time for operating within the rules was past. He had already taken a first
step, aided unwittingly by a bureaucrat of immense ambition within the
ministry. His first counterploy against Noda had bought time—how much he didn't
know— but the next move must be decisive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He glanced around his office, then at the MITI reports stacked
high on his desk. Benkei at the Bridge. For Kenji Asano only one course was
left. He would now have to use his own master, MITI, to destroy Matsuo Noda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His mind went back to the meeting at his MITI office Monday
of the previous week. Although he was on temporary assignment at the Institute,
he still checked in daily at the ministry. Filing into his office at
nine-thirty sharp had been the three men whose &quot;consensus&quot; was
crucial. The difficulty was, they must never know what he planned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Michio Watanabe, International Trade Policy Bureau,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Trade
Research Section: heavyset, early fifties, a professional bureaucrat with
powerful eyes and a permanent expression of skepticism. He had been a close
colleague of Noda's for decades.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tanzan Kitano, Industrial Policy Bureau, International
Enterprises Section: gray hair tinged with silver, immaculate dresser, spoke
five languages. He had been in MITI over twenty years and had maintained the
same mistress for fifteen: a man respected for his long-range thinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hiromu Ikeda, Industrial Technology Agency: late thirties,
thrived on expediency, doing the job no matter the consequences. Part of a hard
new breed, he was Japan's future. And MlTI was his future.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While the men moved toward the wide couch across from his
desk, Kenji Asano opened with offhand pleasantries, directed mainly toward
Watanabe, partly because he was eldest and partly to sound out his mind-state.
Next he welcomed Kitano with a few inquiries concerning his wife and son, a
transparent formality since he was known far and wide to despise them both.
Finally he greeted Ikeda and indicated the meeting would be short, knowing the
younger man liked to move directly to matters at hand and regarded the usual
preliminaries as an old-fashioned waste of time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Agenda: The American companies Matsuo Noda was acquiring. A
proposition had surfaced (in Japanese bureaucracies, all ideas are anonymous
and thus devoid of repercussions) that certain MITI personnel be put on leave
of absence to serve on the boards of those U.S. concerns. Given the heavy
participation of Japanese monies in Noda's American program, perhaps a more
formal monitoring mechanism would be helpful to head off potential anxiety in
Tokyo's financial community.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The idea, of course, was Kenji Asano's. He had first laid the
groundwork with a few oblique hints to several of Dai Nippon's major
institutional backers, particularly the Dai-Ichi Credit Corporation, Ltd. That
move had borne fruit. Within days they had begun wondering aloud whether the
ministry might wish to consider helping oversee Noda's American investments. So
far, so good. Now MITI itself had to be convinced. This meeting would
undoubtedly be the first of many, resulting eventually in a consensus. Would
the ministry go along?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Having set forth the topic, Kenji Asano surrendered the floor
to Watanabe, the senior man present—and therefore the one whose views, in
keeping with convention, would be listened to and applauded by everyone else in
the room whether they agreed or not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In my judgment, the original objectives of Matsuo Noda
and Dai Nippon are the most desirable means of maintaining the long-term
security of Japan,&quot; Watanabe declared. &quot;It is in our strategic
interest that he be allowed to succeed. Which is why MITI should stay 'hands-off,'
should limit its participation to an advisory capacity, nothing more. Anything
further could well prove extremely counterproductive in our relations with the
United States. We do not need more friction.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So deshoo, Watanabe-san.&quot; Kitano, the man second
in seniority, nodded after a moment's pause. &quot;I totally concur with the
basic aspects of the viewpoint you have expressed.&quot; He was telling
everybody he hadn't made up his mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I also support fully Watanabe-san's insightful summary
of the relevant issues.&quot; Ikeda spoke up, his honorifics far more polite
than necessary, a signal. &quot;<i>Keredomo </i>(however) . . . it might
possibly be prudent to examine briefly the considerations advanced by those who
differ with this wise assessment in order that we may counter their concerns
more thoughtfully.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was it. Kenji Asano had a head count. Watanabe was
against sending MITI personnel. Kitano was waffling. Hiromu Ikeda was
foursquare and hell-bent in favor of the idea. He had just announced it to the
room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was Watanabe in league with Noda, willing to give him free
rein? Was he one of Noda's operatives inside the ministry? Or was he merely
advancing his own ideas, genuinely fearful an influx of MITI personnel into the
U.S. could precipitate a severe diplomatic flap?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the other hand, why was Ikeda so in favor of having MITI
move in on Noda? The answer to that was hardly a puzzle. MITI's young prince of
ambition, Hiromu Ikeda, scented the possibility of grabbing a part of Matsuo
Noda's new American empire for his own. Handled skillfully, it might well
catapult him directly to vice minister inside a decade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps it would be useful to review once more the main
elements of the situation.&quot; Kitano knew he had the middle ground and thus
was offering to arbitrate. &quot;The condition of America now is very
troubling. The question is, how can we best aid them, and ourselves. We in
Japan realize that a nation's true strength is ultimately not in armaments but
in the health of its economy, its industry. Yet the Americans, by making
themselves a military state, have paradoxically imperiled their real security.
How long can we continue to rely on an ally so blind to the main threat to its
own strategic well- being? Matsuo Noda is correct. Our very safety may soon be
imperiled. Something must be done. The only question is how best to
proceed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>So desu ne</i>.&quot; Watanabe pressed, realizing he
would have to force his point. &quot;The Pentagon is, ironically, America's
most insidious enemy. Japan's greatest benefit from America's defense umbrella
has not been the billions we've saved on sterile arms; it has been the
technical manpower we have free to support competitive industries. But the
price has been the industrial decline of our foremost ally. This cannot, must
not, be permitted to continue.&quot; He paused. &quot;Matsuo Noda, a man I've
known and respected for years, who guided this ministry to greatness, should be
allowed to assist the Americans rebuild their civilian sector unhindered by us.
If MITI involves itself at this time, the American government may well grow
alarmed and step in to stop him. Then their industrial stagnation will merely
accelerate.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>So deshoo</i>,&quot; Ikeda finally spoke. &quot;I
agree. Unfortunately, however, there are some who believe the task Noda-sama
has undertaken cannot succeed without direct MITI assistance. Again it is a
matter of our own security. The question has arisen concerning whether we
should continue to rely on the Americans to rescue their industrial base
unassisted by any formal direction. Of course I disagree with such pessimistic
views, but some would say we ourselves must now step forward and assume global
leadership in technology to prevent a vacuum from developing in the Free World.
By taking charge of America's floundering high-tech sector, we could rescue it
from continued mismanagement, while—incidentally—satisfying our own R&amp;D
needs in a way that is extremely cost- effective. However, this can only be
achieved if we are in a position to provide hands-on guidance. Which means
direct MITI involvement.&quot; He paused. &quot;These opinions of course are
not my own, merely ones I have heard voiced. I am told, though it is difficult
to comprehend, that this viewpoint has</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>been
entertained by Nakayama-sama of the Secretariat, and even discussed in his
weekly conference with the Parliamentary Vice Minister.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The hand of fate! Asano exulted. Hiromu Ikeda has already
done my work for me. He's gone over everybody's head. He swallowed the idea
like a carp snapping a hovering dragonfly, then went off and peddled it to the
Vice Minister as though it were his own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A man to watch out for in the future, he thought. But a
perfect ally at the moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Watanabe said nothing. His ancient face was in shock.
Everybody realized the meeting was over. It was clear Ikeda had trampled on
consensus and seniority in order to further his own fortunes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Watanabe-san, I think we all agree your understanding
of the situation is entirely proper,&quot; Kenji Asano said soothingly.
&quot;But solely in the interest of continued theoretical discussion at some
later time, it might be prudent if all sections prepared a contingency list of
staff, fluent in English, who would be suitable for reassignment to an American
sector.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is always wise to cover contingencies,
Asano-san,&quot; Watanabe said dryly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>None of them realized it, of course, but Hiromu Ikeda's
ambition could well turn out to be the salvation of MITI itself. But for now,
Asano mused, that was something none of them needed to know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Looking out the window at the freezing streets below,
glimmering from headlights and neon, Kenji Asano told himself that a dangerous
game lay ahead. Noda's first gambit had been countered, but there would be
more. What he needed was a preemptive strike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had made the plans for that strike, a play of pure,
absolute genius. The catch was, Tamara would have to cooperate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With that thought he reached down and unlocked the top
right-hand drawer of his metal desk, then drew out a large red and blue
envelope. It was air express from a university address in California. As he
fingered the stripes along its side, he recalled how it had arrived here at his
office at The Institute for New Generation Computer Technology while he'd been
in Kyoto with Tamara.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally he opened it again and slipped out the contents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Inside was a
confidential memo on the old Nippon, Inc. letterhead, unsigned but obviously
authored by Matsuo Noda, a top-security document that had been clocked in at a
document station at Tsukuba Science City. How had Allan Stern stumbled onto
this? Had he stolen it? Picked it up by accident? It was in Japanese, so how
could he have sensed its real import?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>American ingenuity, he told himself, defied all
understanding. The memo, which outlined the timetable for a massive scenario,
had been the first step of a long path of discovery leading Kenji Asano to
indisputable proof of Matsuo Noda's real objective. Allan Stern must have had
this translated or somehow intuitively guessed Noda's plan. And then . . .
Allan Stem had tried to warn MITI. Why? Out of past regard for Dr. Yoshida,
former head of the Institute and a close friend?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stern reportedly had vanished the same day this envelope was
postmarked. Noda had acted, but not swiftly enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Who at MITI had been the original recipient of this memo?
Maybe, he thought, it no longer mattered. There was only one real way to stop
Dai Nippon. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment his phone buzzed. As he punched the button,
his flustered secretary announced that an in-flight call was waiting, channeled
through MITI's satellite security link. It was the president of Dai Nippon,
International.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tsukuba Science City can be awe-inspiring or a specter,
depending on how you choose to look at it. The time was Wednesday morning, and
Tam and I were viewing the place through the tinted windows of Matsuo Noda's
personal DNI limo, the black Nissan she knew so well. From the vantage of an
elevated freeway packed with rows of sleek Hondas and Toyotas sparkling in the
cold December sunshine, we could see the silhouettes of cluster after cluster
of modernistic concrete towers, an urban complex of a hundred and fifty
thousand souls rising above what was, only a few short years ago, mostly farms.
Be that as it may, take my word for it that nobody's growing radishes there
today. Science City, nestled in the foothills of Mt. Tsukuba some fifty
kilometers northeast of downtown Tokyo, represents a government investment,
including the industrial park once the site of Expo '85, of over thirty billion
dollars.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tsukuba is holy ground, the place of heroes, where kamikazes
once trained for their suicide missions against the American fleet. Now it is
one of the largest research centers in the world, with almost ten thousand
scientists and fifty separate laboratories and scientific institutes. As we
neared the first complex, I tried to make sense of all the Dali-esque curved
buildings that housed Japan's new brain trust. From the outside you can tell
something is going on, but it seems secretive and proprietary. It is. The thing
I had to keep reminding myself, though, was that none of this was for military
boondoggles. It was aimed dead-on at industrial technology. E.g., there's
research here on high-energy lasers all right, but they're not intended for
zapping some hypothetical Soviet satellite; they're part of the world's largest
laser-radar telescope, which can project beams out more than thirty miles to
analyze air quality. In short, the work here was applications-oriented,
practical, and—get a firm grip on your wallet— commercial.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Together with Noda and his bodyguard/chauffeur we were headed
for the Electrotechnical Institute, where he was about to give us our first
glimpse of Japan's new high-tech empire. That lab just so happened to be the
place where heavy work was underway on applications of the artificial intelligence
effort of Kenji Asano's Fifth Generation shop. It was merely the first stop,
however, in an odyssey Noda claimed would take us through the hidden heart of
Japan's industrial future.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda reported he had spoken with Kenji Asano, who was
unfortunately tied up in meetings and couldn't join us until tomorrow. Thus Tam
had not yet had her chance to hear his account of MITI's sudden new interest in
Dai Nippon's program. All the same, Noda claimed to welcome Ken's arrival.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Whatever concerns you may have, I'm sure he will be
more than happy to address them,&quot; declared the president of Dai Nippon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam had tried on her own to reach Ken at his office, without
success. Maybe, I thought to myself, he just didn't want to talk. In any case
that quandary remained unresolved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The way I saw the situation, though, we had enough to deal
with merely getting through today. Noda's game was no longer a game. He was
going to take us to the top of the mountain, show us the other side, and then .
. . what? Whatever it was, that part would have to be handled in due time. For
now his intentions seemed to be to drive home a singular point: if you think
Dai Nippon has been playing hardball with money, wait till you see Japan's real
action. He was going to lay bare the empire, the awesome machine he now had at
his command. The payoff of Tsukuba, he explained, was intended to be nothing
less than total technological supremacy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The limo was slowing to a stop in front of an oddly shaped
concrete building, brand-new, that covered several acres with cones and
hexagons and various geometries. We'd arrived.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is the Electrotechnical Institute, research center
for Japan's Advanced Robot Technology Project.&quot; He pointed. The laboratory
appeared to be somebody's idea of what architecture would be in the
twenty-first century, a sort of Japanese spaceship splattered across a vast
acreage. &quot;The work underway here and over at the Mechanical Engineering
lab is intended to coordinate all government and private research on industrial
robots.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stepped out and motioned for us to join him. Our top-
secret tour had begun. As we walked toward the main entryway, he delivered an
opening summary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Here we have allocated twenty billion yen, about a
hundred and fifty million dollars, for an eight-year research program to
perfect a range of industrial robots.&quot; He continued while we walked past
the small gray metallic sign, in both Japanese and English, that identified the
Institute. &quot;It is being closely coordinated with the spin-offs of the
Fifth Generation AI work.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I noticed that no guards were posted, though the metal doors
were tightly sealed. Noda didn't bother to take out a key as he proceeded.
&quot;The Advanced Robot Technology Project coordinates the research of over
twenty corporations as well as R&amp;D at various universities, and this lab is
where we integrate all the results of that work.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean different parts or robots are being created at
separate research operations, then brought together here?&quot; I probably
shouldn't have been surprised by the tight, nationwide coordination. Typical
Japan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Precisely. Robots have a multiplicity of elements.
There are manipulators, the mechanical versions of our hands; then there are
the senses of vision and touch; and finally there is movement, locomotion. Each
of these is being developed individually, then combined here. For example, if a
robot is to understand voice commands—in effect making its operator a
programmer—then it must incorporate the speech recognition work of the Fifth
Generation Project, which will supply the eyes, the ears, the brain.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe that's where Asano comes in, I thought. Could it be
he's the point man here for artificial intelligence, on board to oversee
creating the computerized brains for all these babies. Was he yet another DNI
operative, witting or unwitting, just as Tam and I had been?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda's lecture was still underway. &quot;The first generation
of robots does things by rote, the same motion repeated dumbly over and over
again. What we call the second generation are those with crude sensing abilities,
perhaps touch pads or video, though they are still stationary.&quot; He placed
his hand over a small screen by the door. A light flashed under his
palm-—presumably allowing a computer somewhere to analyze his handprint—and a
second later the door slid open. Then he continued, &quot;The goal of the work
here is a third-generation robot. You might almost call it a functional
'android,' since it will be able to move, see, and think much as we do. Whether
it will actually look like a human is another matter, but that's not
necessarily even a useful objective.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Intelligent monsters in silicon and steel, I found myself
thinking. All our fantasies, or nightmares, come to life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I didn't have to look far to see that they were already in
the womb. We were entering the main laboratory floor now, surrounded by what
seemed a Martian landscape of mechanical creatures. The place was bustling, yet
spotless as a hospital ward. Noda acknowledged the deep bows of several of the
shirt-sleeved staff, then continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Although visitors are not normally permitted in the
sensitive areas here, I have arranged total-access priority for you both. I
consider you among the few Americans today who can understand the strategic
significance of this program.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If Matsuo Noda was really saying that he intended to give us
a sobering dose of Japan's impending high-tech clout, he was off to a bang-up
start.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he turned and greeted a short, white-uniformed man.
&quot;Allow me to introduce Dr. Noburu Matsugami, who is senior staff
specialist for the program here. Dr. Matsugami will be your guide today.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Matsugami was close to fifty and balding, with short- cropped
hair that seemed to stand out on the sides of his head like the bristles of a
metal brush. He was bowing to Noda every other second, as though he'd just been
summoned by God. He attempted a smile, then greeted us in Japanese, followed by
accented English.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I surveyed the floor—steel and aluminum and computers—
feeling as if I could have been on another planet. Tam, strangely, had said
scarcely a word the whole time. She probably knew about a lot of this, but
surely not the proprietary, advanced devices.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda's glimpse of Japan's industrial &quot;Manhattan
Project&quot; was one of the most memorable experiences of my life. Although I
suspect the devices he let Matsugami show us were just the toys, they still
were enough to leave no doubt where things were headed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without going into the classified details, let me attempt to
describe a few of the items I still remember. I was particularly impressed by
the Waseda University/Hitachi walking robot WHL-II, which uses advanced machine
technology and computer control to move just as a human does, two-legged style.
Its hydraulic steel joints and carbon-fiber muscles, together with its
computerized foot sensors, give it walking skills better than most young
humans'. Its brain of course is a microprocessor, programmed to let it walk in
different styles, just as we do. Other mobile robots had four legs, even
six—such as the Titan III, which we saw climb up a set of stairs like a
metallic sci-fi spider.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As for robot hands, the most advanced also were from
Hitachi's mechanical engineering research lab. Unlike most robot grippers,
little more than glorified vises, this one had three fingers (which Matsugami
claimed were more agile than a version at MIT) whose &quot;muscles&quot; were a
heat-sensitive metal (invented in the U.S.) that would contract when an
electric current passed through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vision research was also well advanced. A Matsushita robot
equipped with a computerized &quot;eye&quot; was able to analyze the lines and
shadows of a human face and then draw a black-and- white sketch like a sidewalk
artist. Even more amazing, a robot with a TV-camera eye—developed jointly by
Waseda University and Sumitomo Electric—could read sheet music and play it on a
keyboard using mechanical fingers. This android pianist employed recent
advances in artificial intelligence to determine the best fingering for each
phrase and even took requests for tunes in spoken Japanese. Play it again, HAL.
Other robots with &quot;voice recognition&quot; capability allowed a human
operator simply to sit in one spot and command the mobile machine where to go
and what to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At one point Tam asked Matsugami for a candid opinion on how
far along he thought the Advanced Robot-Technology Program had progressed.
Well, he replied, sucking in his breath pensively, the manual dexterity problem
was about licked: the robot arms now being perfected could pick up anything and
move it anywhere. Vision and programmable intelligence were harder, but he felt
their research was getting close. Already he had robots that could analyze and
interpret 3-D objects and scenes, enabling them to maneuver around a factory
floor and make decisions of almost human complexity. The ultimate objective was
factory-wide systems for Computer-Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) that would
allow every operation of a company, from design to engineering to
manufacturing, to be controlled by computer via a single data base. It was
cheap, and it elevated quality control to a hundred percent. No doubt about it,
he said, as Japan moved to automate manufacturing and get on with an
information- industry future, these smart robots would be their secret weapon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Institute's mechanical menagerie, I realized, was what
the next century was going to look like. Except it was here now. As Matsugami
took us through lab after lab, it became clear that the Japanese
&quot;third-generation&quot; functionoid robot was all but a reality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda's message was clear. Already Japan was spending twice as
much on new manufacturing technology as America was. They led the world in
robotics and that lead was growing. With the coming of that third
generation—robots that could</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>see, move,
and think—world industrial leadership would be up for grabs. These were the
stakes Japan was betting on the twenty-first century. Anybody who planned to
play against them better have something on the table too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At the end of the tour as dusk was beginning to settle in,
Noda reappeared and escorted us back to the limo. And that's when he laid it out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Richardson, what you and Mr. Walton have just seen
is merely a glimpse of the real peril to America's future.&quot; He was closing
the door of the car. &quot;There is much, much more . . . projects such as the
rapid commercialization of superconductivity. America's world supremacy is at a
crossroads.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why are you showing us this?&quot; Tam was still
troubled by the same question that was eating at me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very simple, really. Thus far we have, together,
attempted to address some of the more egregious ineptitudes in America's
corporate management. Our success in that, if I may say, has already been
substantial. However, the best-managed organization cannot flourish without the
tools required to take it the next step. That translates as technology.&quot;
He paused, then looked at us both. &quot;Do you understand what I'm
saying?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Japan now has the technology, just as it has the
money,&quot; Tam answered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You are correct. Thus far Dai Nippon has merely
provided a conduit to infuse capital into the American industrial scene. That
was the easy part. The task remaining will be much more difficult.&quot; He
looked at us. &quot;Difficult because, for this, America must share in
return.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You want to make a deal, I take it.&quot; I finally
spoke. Funny, but I thought I sounded a little like Faust beginning
negotiations with the devil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He smiled. &quot;That is a blunt way of describing what I am
about to suggest, Mr. Walton, but it does capture the spirit of my proposal.
America excels in basic research, Japan in applied research, in engineering.
The time has come to join forces.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you have seen, the monetary resources at Dai
Nippon's disposal make it possible for us to wield significant influence.&quot;
He smiled. &quot;Japanese capital has been brought to America; Japanese
technology can be brought as well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;At a price.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;At a price, yes. But a modest one really.&quot; He
smiled again, then buzzed for his driver to start the car. &quot;Let me put it
like this. If you choose to proceed with me in the next step of Dai Nippon's
program, I will arrange for everything you have seen today to be my gift to
America. All I ask from you both is complete cooperation in the days ahead.
Together we can forge an informal alliance between Japan and America that could
alter the course of world history. But it must be done in an atmosphere of
complete trust.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam was astonished. &quot;You'd make this manufacturing
technology available to American industry? Why?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As part of a quid pro quo, Dr. Richardson. It's quite
simple. In return I would expect complete access to the R&amp;D in the firms
Dai Nippon has acquired.&quot; He stared back through his rimless glasses.
&quot;Which, I gather, is a notion you find a trifle unsettling.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>You bastard, I thought. You did have my phone tapped. How
else could you have known what she was thinking?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She shot me a telling glance. &quot;How does all this fit in
with the new MITI guidance we're suddenly getting?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is a separate matter, Dr. Richardson, which we
will address in due course. What I am concerned with now is something else
entirely—the final step in restoring America to economic health. The first
requirement was long-term capital and better management, which Dai Nippon has
now begun to provide. The next is technology, a small foretaste of which I have
shown you today.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was this, I wondered, the big picture, the <i>kan </i>we'd
been trying to get a handle on?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What I'm proposing,&quot; Noda continued, &quot;is that
together we become partners in the creation of a massive Japanese- American
consortium. Perhaps we could call it Nipponica.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nipponica?&quot; She kept her tone even.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The name has an interesting ring to it, does it not? As
I envision the organization, you would be its American CEO.&quot; He paused.
&quot;I would chair the board.&quot; Then he turned to me. &quot;And you, Mr.
Walton, could be invaluable as chief corporate counsel.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The man had gone totally mad. Or had he?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I still don't understand how this venture could be
brought together. You'd be dealing with hundreds of companies, a worldwide
management headache.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton, what other choice do we have? Given the
precipitous decline of America's global leadership, together with Japan's
economic and technological rise, there can be only two possible outcomes of the
inevitable direction affairs are headed: bankruptcy for us both, or war. The
time has come for risk-taking, for a belief in the human spirit. We each need
the other more than our political leaders can allow themselves to admit, and
thus steps must be taken outside normal diplomatic channels to bring us closer
together.&quot; He continued, in perfect form, &quot;Both America and Japan would
benefit from a commingling of our industry and research. We would learn from
each other, find strength in unity, realize a common perspective on global
concerns. Our economies would be joined, our peoples united. Instead of
friction and the saber rattling of trade disputes, we would have the harmony of
a single enterprise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who exactly is going to finance and operate this
undertaking?&quot; I was listening to him describe his planned-for Utopia with
increasing skepticism. But he had already rocked America, and Japan, to the
core. Not a man to underestimate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you might suppose, Dai Nippon would, by virtue of
its present situation, be ideally suited to lay the groundwork.&quot; He
glanced out the tinted windows. &quot;Afterward the political processes of both
countries would naturally have no choice but to follow our lead, ratifying—as
they always do—conditions that have already become a <i>fait accompli</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It had all the easy resonance of a grand historical
venture, except . . . except what if this was still <i>ken</i>,
superficialities, not <i>kan</i>, the real truth?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Before we go any further, I think Dr.
Richardson and I should talk this over.&quot; I looked up to see the Tsukuba
Hotel, where we were scheduled to stay overnight. Noda had made other
accommodations for himself, saying he also needed to drop by the Metallurgy Lab
and check to see how work was going on the sword. My scheduled viewing was to
be tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I agree.&quot; Tam looked at me sharply. &quot;We can
discuss this more in the morning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you wish.&quot; The limo was pulling to a stop.
&quot;Tomorrow should be an interesting day for you both. We can continue our
discussions then.&quot; He smiled. &quot;However, be aware that time is of the
essence.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With that parting shot, the long black Nissan sped away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, let's see if this place has a bar. I need a drink.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Double.&quot; She was carrying the small overnight bag
Noda's New York staff had handed her as we left. I had one too, just a shirt
and essentials.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The hotel saloon was modernistic, vinyl, and leaned heavily
toward Japanese beer and Suntory whiskey. By now some middle-level executives
were getting off work at the labs and dropping in to start their usual evening
round of drinking, but at this early hour it was still sparsely occupied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We headed for a comer table and ordered a couple of draft
Kirin. After the beers arrived, we got down to brass tacks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What the hell was Noda's real agenda?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Two heads, so the saying goes, are better than one. I don't
know, could be they're worse. Because as Tam and I sat there, Noda's offer to
head up some kind of new world consortium dangling before us, what our two
heads came up with was the scariest thing that'd ever crossed my path.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe it was the thought of America's working stiffs, whose
jobs Noda supposedly was so determined to save. Trouble was, I didn't buy that
in the slightest anymore. So what made any sense?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Simple. Why not the most obvious answer of all? Noda wasn't
doing this for them. Or for Japan. That wasn't his game. Noda was planning this
grand design for Noda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam.&quot; I sipped at my beer. &quot;Did you believe a
word of what he said?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course not. At least not the United Nations speech.
It's pure hogwash.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Totally agree. But he's about to do something big, I'm
convinced.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Got any ideas.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Luckily the place was getting noisier now, so nobody could
have been listening even if they'd tried. Which was the very reason I wanted to
talk in the bar and not in either of our rooms. Who knew the reach of Noda's
electronic ears?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not really. But what if we stepped back a second and
tried looking at this latest move from a longer view. Maybe we've been tangled
up in the trees, missing the forest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We've seen plenty of forest lately.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what if it's the wrong one? Let's try the <i>teki
ni naru to iu koto </i>strategy, become the enemy. Pretend for a minute we're
Noda, a guy who's got it all—money, clout, everything. So why</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>does he all
of a sudden want to come across the Pacific and buy himself a load of
industrial headaches, then hand them Japan's technology?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's MITI somehow. I'm convinced that's the key. Which
is why I'm going to nail Ken.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, let's not jump to conclusions. I'm wondering.
What if Dai Nippon is taking over American industry not because it's strategic
to MITI as those memos we found would lead us to think. What if the reason is
because it's strategic to Noda?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What if his relationship to that ministry is something
totally different from what it seems?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, if MITI's not behind the buy-ups, then who're
they for?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I sat a minute, again trying to think like Noda. &quot;What
if this scenario is actually aimed at . . . what if it's a global power
play?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked at me skeptically. &quot;I don't get it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, granted it sounds crazy, but let's chase that for
a minute. I think we agree this whole scenario is not what he wants it to seem.
So what are some of the other things in all this that aren't what they appear
to be? Does anything dovetail?&quot; I sat musing a second, searching for an
opening. &quot;What are some of the twists about Japan that're obviously
misleading?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, acceptance of <i>gaijin</i>, for one. It goes only
so far, then stops like a brick wall.&quot; She was obviously speaking from
personal experience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe that's because they've always been isolated. Some
things never change,&quot; I pondered aloud. &quot;Which is probably the secret
of their success. Take the ruling clique. Sure, Japan is a democracy, but is it
really? Not the way we understand the word. What they actually have, after you
get past all the slogans, is just a retread of the old system. The truth is
it's still run as it was a thousand years ago. By the old families, the old
money. Elections never decide issues. They're handled by the power structure.
Half the seats in the Diet are practically hereditary, going back generations
in the same family. There's only one real political party. The ministries are fiefdoms.
I mean, the goddam country is still feudal. They don't even have a word for
democracy. They had to borrow it. <i>Demokurasu</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, Japan's a pragmatic place. The old ways work.
Remember the <i>zaibatsu</i>, those industrial conglomerates that ran the war
machine? MacArthur dismantled them, but they reappeared almost as soon as he
left.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right, the power structure restored those right away.
The zaibatsu are back and chewing up world commerce. But the <i>demokurasu</i>
eyewash is still around. The job's not finished.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>She stared around the room. &quot;Matt, I don't like
where I think you're headed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I agree it's sick, but let's push it a little more.
What is it about Japan that's made it such a dynamo the last couple of
decades?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hard work, organization, drive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Exactly. But where did that come from?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They had to have it. Over the centuries most Japanese
were dirt poor. They had to hustle just to survive. Matthew, Japan is a
collectivist society driven by capitalism, an idea so alien to the West nobody
can even see it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perfect description. Only problem is, all this <i>demokurasu
</i>is sooner or later going to start cutting away the very thing that's made
Japan so successful—a country powered by obedient, collective action and glued
together by hierarchy and tradition.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're saying Noda wants to turn back the clock?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't know. But what if these industrialists, these <i>zaibatsu
</i>honchos, are fed up with having to deal with all the cumbersome <i>demokurasu</i>
machinery. And they're especially fed up with a certain ministry making them
jump the hoop. Tam, what if Noda's real agenda is to go to America and buy
himself a gun to hold to MITI's head.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You don't think he's buying America's companies to help
MITI?&quot; She looked unconvinced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If I had money to bet, I'd almost be willing to put it
on the possibility he's buying leverage to use against MITI and through them
the whole inefficient government setup. How come MITI's suddenly sending staff
over to look in on Noda's play? Could it be somebody there's figured out what
he's up to and they want to head him off? They realize Matsuo Noda is the only
man on the planet who could conceivably beat MITI at its own game? Bring it to
its knees? First he acquired control of half the capital in Japan, then he came
to the U.S. and started grabbing up all the R&amp;D that'll be competing with
MITI through the end of the century. When he's got it, he'll have a power base
to match theirs. He's set to call the new tune.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Which is?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who knows? But try this for an agenda: time to cut the
crap, Noda's thinking, get rid of all the clumsy Western-style <i>demokurasu</i>
charade, tighten up, lean and mean. Go back to the only system that's ever
really clicked for Japan. Imperial rule. Make the 'Land of the Gods' sacred and
invincible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is getting wild.&quot; She lowered her voice.
&quot;But maybe . . . maybe you could be right. He just happens to locate the
Imperial sword, and suddenly the emperor is resurrected from a discredited
figurehead back to a symbol of Japan's greatness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Here comes that old-time religion. Everybody goes
traditional, right on cue, and the nutty Japan Firsters are thriving again,
just like the thirties.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good Lord.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Doesn't it all fit somehow? Matsuo Noda started off by
creating this shadow outfit, Dai Nippon, in order to get his hands on all his
countrymen's money. Now the next step will be to start phasing out the <i>demokurasu
</i>frills and the powerless prime minister and the MITI bureaucrats and
turning the place into a kick-ass machine again. Look out world.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;One small problem. The emperor can't rule Japan. Not
really. He's a living god. Which means . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;See? That difficulty's nothing new. For a thousand
years the emperor's had no real clout anyway. The nitty-gritty of running Japan
was always the job of his stand-in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a long pause. We both avoided speaking the word,
but there it was. Finally she leaned back and closed her eyes, her voice barely
audible above the din of the bar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good to see you again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How did you . . .?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He chuckled as he switched on the light by the chair.
&quot;Rank in MITI has its moments.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I thought you were coming tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I am, officially.&quot; He rose and moved toward her.
&quot;But tonight I'd hoped we could be together.&quot; He smiled.
&quot;Alone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stood in the open doorway, unmoving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, we have a lot to talk about, all right.&quot; She
closed the door. &quot;And I don't mean in bed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Truthfully, she wasn't even sure she wanted to see him at
all. The Dai Nippon scenario was getting too complicated, too insidious. Noda's
play was turning into something with worldwide implications.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tamara, I came because we need to talk. I think you're
in danger. Maybe we both are.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;From Noda? Just because he's a megalomaniac—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You think it's that simple?&quot; he interrupted.
&quot;Don't be so sure. For now let's just say he's very, very clever, and very
powerful.&quot; He reached out to welcome her. &quot;But whatever he is, the
time has come to stop him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think Matt and I just figured out why. He's a threat
to MITI, isn't he, Ken? A peril to your power base.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's a threat to everybody. But yes, MITI is definitely
in his way at this point. Or at least I'm in his way. Somebody has to be.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what do you expect me to do about it? As a matter of
fact, what has MITI done for me lately except try and move in on my work?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, you can't stand up to Noda alone. But maybe
together we can, at least for a while.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What makes you think . . .?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have a weapon at my disposal. A powerful weapon. The
ministry. If we can use it to focus attention on what he's—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I want to speed up the ministry's involvement. Bring in
lots more people. We do that and we'll—-&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I see.&quot; She slipped past him and headed for the
second chair. 'That's a terrific idea. Give it all to MITI.&quot; For a moment
there she'd almost been ready to start trusting him again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, we only have to make it seem that's what is
happening.&quot; He turned to face her. &quot;It'll be like waving a red flag under
the nose of your Congress. Surely that'll wake everybody up to what he's doing.
They'd move in and stop him cold. Guaranteed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, Matsuo Noda made me a very intriguing proposition
today. Matter of fact, it sounds better than yours.&quot; She got up and walked
over to the small refrigerator fitted under the sink. &quot;Want a beer? I'm
going to have one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right.&quot; He looked at her. &quot;What were you
saying just now? About a proposition?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Noda asked me to head up a Japanese-American consortium
run as a single industry. It's almost as if he wants to put together an
American version of MITI, an organization that can oversee and coordinate
American R&amp;D nationwide.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you believe he means what he says?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She turned and stared at him for a moment. &quot;I guess the
honest answer is no. I think it's just a smokescreen to get his hands on
everything he wants in the U.S., disguised under the rubric of
assistance.&quot; She retrieved two cans of cold Asahi and popped the tops.
&quot;On the other hand, you're suggesting we have to give America's industry
to MITI in order to save it from Matsuo Noda.&quot; She extended a can of beer
and a glass. &quot;Right now, I don't trust MITI any more than I trust
him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tamara, this is a high-stakes game. Against a man with
more money and power than the world has ever seen in one place. It's not going
to be easy to stop him. It's also going to be risky. For us both.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And you think a MITI takeover is the answer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's the only thing that's left.&quot; He sobered.
&quot;Unfortunately it'll also damage MITI's political credibility badly
worldwide. But that's the price I'm willing to pay to stop Noda. What other
choice is there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hurt MITI? I'm not so sure. Taking over all of DNI's
American research labs should give quite a boost to your Marketshare - 90
program, wouldn't it. You'd be acquiring America's high-tech sector for Japan
all nicely wrapped up in a bundle.&quot; She poured from her can. &quot;Ought
to trim years off your timetable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know where you heard about that, Tam.&quot;
Vague surprise in his voice. &quot;But that's not a real program. Market- share
- 90 is just a planning exercise over in the General Affairs Section. Part of
some training for their new people.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When we asked Noda about it, he seemed to think it was
real enough.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then he was just bluffing. He had to be.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, what do you take me for . . .?&quot; She wasn't
sure how much more double-talk she could stand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He waved his hand to stop her. &quot;Please. Just trust me
for this once. That's all I ask.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're sure as hell not making it easy. I think it's
time you told me what's really going on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right. I'll show you the bottom line. Maybe then
you'll accept the truth.&quot; He got up and went over to his briefcase.
&quot;I have something in here you ought to see.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's an advance text of the speech His Majesty delivers
on January second.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's his annual New Year's appearance at the Imperial
palace, right? When he bestows his blessings upon the land.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Exactly.&quot; He pulled out the sheet. &quot;I think
this sheds light on a lot of things. Here. I made a rough English translation,
just to hear how it sounds.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She took the paper, torn from a yellow legal pad, and began
to read.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The speech began with a long-winded celebration of the famous
Yasukuni Shrine, home of the spirits of all Japanese warriors. That shrine, His
Majesty then went on to declare, was increasingly misconstrued by the world as
a symbol of Japanese militarism, a misapprehension both unfortunate and untrue,
since Japan had indeed renounced martial force forever. However, to reinforce
that commitment in the eyes of a nervous world, he was now announcing the
dedication of a new national shrine to Japan's spirit that would have no such
misleading overtones. This new shrine, at Tsukuba Science City, would be a
memorial to the peaceful use of technology, to man's mastery of the physical
world sanctified so long ago by the Shinto gods.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked up. &quot;A new national shrine? Nice political
move.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Better read the rest before you jump to
conclusions.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She glanced down and continued on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It had further been decided, the Emperor would say, that the
newly recovered Imperial sword would not be housed at Ise after all. It would
instead be the centerpiece of this new memorial to Japanese technology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, she thought, it still sounds okay. Theme shrines are
perfectly within tradition. After all, the Meiji Shrine in Tokyo commemorated
the nineteenth-century emperor who began Japan's modernization. However, the
thing to remember was that new shrines can have a philosophical subtext. The
Meiji told the Japanese that their country had accepted Westernization. So,
given that the creation of a new shrine can embody a message to everybody, she
found herself wondering what word was being sent out this time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Emperor would go on to spell this out, lest any of his
subjects were too dense to get the picture. Unlike the Yasukuni Shrine, he
would say, this new memorial at Tsukuba would not commemorate Japan's warrior
past; rather it would celebrate a modern Japan whose world eminence would be
fashioned not with arms but through economic struggle. In so doing, it would
symbolize the regeneration of Japan's ancient spirit, <i>Yamato damashi</i>, of
which the <i>bushido </i>of the samurai was merely one manifestation, only a
stage. Grander things were on the way. Japan's rightful place in the new world
order was only now coming into its own. The new Tsukuba <i>damashi </i>would
harness modern technology to Japan's ancient traditions, would put the new at
the service of the old.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What he was really telling his people, she realized, in
oblique language only they would comprehend, was that Japan was now prepared to
wage open confrontation through commerce—their trading state pitted against the
world's military states, whose economic base and martial ascendancy they would
now proceed to challenge through technological superiority and cutthroat trade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, does this mean what I think it means?&quot; She
passed back the yellow page.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you think it means Noda's got him now, then the
answer is yes. He's co-opted the Imperial house.&quot; He took the sheet and
returned it to his briefcase. &quot;I'd bet you anything Noda himself wrote
that speech. He's begun, Tamara. His total takeover, of America and
Japan.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She sat a moment in silence, a strange sensation in her
stomach. Did she believe it? She wasn't sure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, there's something you should know. A colleague
came with me on this trip. An American lawyer. Knowing him, he's probably still
down in the bar. I'd like him to read this. Why don't we go down and I'll
introduce you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who is he? Can he be trusted?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As a matter of fact, he's an old friend. From a long
time past. But we've been through a lot together lately.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He leaned back and sipped his beer. &quot;Am I to assume this
traveling companion is more than a casual friend?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's not exactly your worry, is it? I don't pry into
your life when I'm away.&quot; She got up to retrieve another can of beer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You can't blame me for being curious, Tam. It's a
simple, reasonable question.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nothing Kenji Asano does is ever simple, she told herself.
There's always a subtext.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't try to change the subject. One thing at a
time.&quot; She sipped from her glass. &quot;And regarding your plan, as far as
I'm concerned, there's been too much MITI dabbling already. Frankly it pisses
me off.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm sorry if you choose to feel that way, Tam.&quot;
His eyes darkened. &quot;Please believe me when I assure you we're on the same
side. I've told you what I propose doing about Noda. But I haven't heard any of
your ideas.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She sighed and sipped her beer. &quot;I don't have any.
Yet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then why not trust me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Trust. There was that word again. Trouble was, she wasn't
sure she trusted anybody anymore. She rose, strolled to the window, and reached
for the curtain. Should she let him stay the night? Maybe that was just asking
for more heartaches. Letting Japan screw America two ways. With that dismal
thought she pulled open the curtains.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It had begun to snow, a swirl of drifting white.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, come and take a look.&quot; She beckoned him.
&quot;I think I'd like to go outside for a while. I'm weary to death of
arguing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He rose and came over to the window, standing next to her.
&quot;It's just started.&quot; He glanced around the room. &quot;Did you bring
any boots?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, and I don't care. I just want some fresh air to
help clear my head.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right, but we'll have to use the service elevator.
I can't be seen walking through the lobby, not till tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We can take the stairs. Come on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By the time they emerged onto the driveway leading out toward
the road, traffic had slowed to a crawl and the futuristic shapes of Tsukuba's
labs seemed like a fairyland. She noticed that the hotel had its own helicopter
pad, undoubtedly to accommodate MITI officials who needed to pop up for a quick
consultation. The place was high-tech, powerful, frightening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just like Kenji Asano.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, I'm afraid maybe we've lost it, you and me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Lost what?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Whatever we had there in Kyoto.&quot; She sighed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe you've lost it, Tamara.&quot; They were striding
through the first thin film of white that now blanketed the sidewalk
paralleling the road, leaving a trail of flattened footprints. &quot;Nothing
has changed for me. You're welcome to come back and be part of my life anytime
you choose.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, right now I just want to walk in the snow.&quot;
She glanced at him, wondering if she still felt anything at all. &quot;You
know, it's a funny thing, but the snow tonight reminds me of a trip I once
took, years ago, up north to Hokkaido. The innocence, the simplicity, it was
all captured in that pure, endless white.&quot; She looked around them.
&quot;How could Tsukuba Science City even be part of the same country?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He smiled. &quot;As the tour books always say, 'Japan: land
of contrasts.' Well, the old ways are going fast, Tam, except in our hearts.
Some things will always be the same.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell you the truth, that's what scares me the most.
Things like the sword, which can cause this whole country to go crazy
overnight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah yes, the sword. Matsuo Noda's magic talisman. You
know, that's the real reason he'll be so hard to stop. What a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>genius. He
delivers it to the Emperor, almost the same way the Sun Goddess supposedly once
did, and in the process makes himself a living god.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Speaking of the sword, by the way, Matt is going over
to the Metallurgy Lab tomorrow to see it. Live and prime time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The lawyer I told you about.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So his name is Matt?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Short for Matthew. Walton.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, besides being a corporate attorney, he's supposed
to be an amateur expert on swords. Hobby of his.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And Noda is actually letting him see it?&quot; There
was a faint note of surprise in his voice. &quot;Very unusual. That sword has
been kept very tightly under wraps, or so I've heard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Believe it. Tomorrow Matt Walton gets a command
presentation. Courtesy of Noda. He's arranged everything with the Imperial
Household.&quot; She gazed up at the sky, now a white marble reflecting back
the lights from the traffic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, I'd like very much to see it too. Think you could
arrange something with Noda-san?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can try.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, not many people outside the Imperial
Household have actually viewed it really up close. I hear it's almost perfectly
preserved.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then this could be your chance.&quot; She reached and
took his hand. After all, the weather was cold. &quot;I'll ring Noda in the
morning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks. But no matter what happens, with that or
anything else, just seeing you again will make this trip worthwhile.&quot; He
gave her hand a squeeze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right, Ken, dammit you win.&quot; She turned and
slipped her arms around his neck, then drew his lips down to hers. The snow
drifted onto her eyelids. &quot;You're right. I don't have any answers, to
anything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Again she felt almost as though time was running in reverse.
The smoothness of his skin, the ease of his touch, the firm muscles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It'll be over soon, Tam. It has to be. And then we'll
all look back on this like a bad dream.&quot; He encircled her in his arms.
&quot;We'll go off to Hokkaido if you like it so much there. Together. Just you
and me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why is it all the men I know keep offering me
trips?&quot; She laughed and brushed the snow out of his hair. &quot;Matt keeps
trying to get me to go down to the Caribbean. Now you want to take me to
Hokkaido. I sound like everybody's getaway girl.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nobody's called you a girl. You're a woman. You decide
what you want.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, at the moment I just want to go to bed with
you.&quot; She pulled his lips down. &quot;After that I'll worry about the next
move.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We just have to trust each other. That's all that
matters.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, she thought, how could she not trust this man?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At least for tonight. Tomorrow she would think about
tomorrow.</span></p>

<h1><a name=bookmark10><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</span></a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:1.0pt;color:windowtext'><img
width=33 height=33 src="images/image021.jpg" alt=""></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kenji Asano was a very complex human being—Western on the
surface, but with his own personality always glimmering through at the
unexpected moment. He seemed to capture the best of both worlds: the
forthrightness of an American and the intuitive self-confidence I've come to
think of as a hallmark of the East.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Japanese are a subtle people, in the finest sense of the
word, and I normally feel slightly oafish in their land. I always know I'm
missing about three levels of the nuance in whatever's going on. By the same
token, a Japanese venturing into the West frequently seems to be moving as though
he were following the numbers on one of those old Arthur Murray dance diagrams.
The steps are precise and correct, but there's no glide to it, no natural
rhythm. Ken, I must say, had long since gotten past that kind of awkwardness.
His motions were fluid, his reactions quick and natural. Also, he managed to
achieve this while retaining qualities that always reminded you he came from a
culture that was writing Kyoto romances and wearing perfumed silk when London
and Paris still had pigs in their garbage-strewn streets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, you're a phenomenon.&quot; We were climbing into
his blue Toyota sports car, which he'd driven up from Tokyo. Low profile—the
car and the trip. &quot;This play could blow up in your face.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Over our leisurely three-way breakfast in the hotel bar, he
had given me a reasonably detailed sketch of the situation, after which Tam
headed off in the DNI limo for her second day of appointments in the robot
labs. My honest reaction, despite the prickle of jealousy, was instant liking
of Asano. Furthermore, in the absence of anything better, his scheme seemed
worth a shot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now came the sword. A phone call established that Noda had no
objection to Ken's seeing it too, so we were set to head over to the Metallurgy
Lab together. Not a bad time for straight talk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know it's a gamble, Matthew, but I'd like to think of
it as repaying my debt to America.&quot; He inserted his key in the ignition
and started the engine. &quot;In a way I feel some personal responsibility for
the current condition of your technology.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was he about to come clean on the subject of MITI's
semiconductor blitz?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, I once heard you were the brains behind
Japan's memory chip takeover.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Our strategy seemed prudent at the time.&quot; He
sighed, then turned around to begin backing out of the hotel parking lot.
&quot;If you're planning for the long term, the sectors you focus on are
obvious.&quot; He paused to light a Peace, then crumpled the wooden match in
his hand and exhaled as he shifted into drive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And you play hardball.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Otherwise why bother? I guess we had no idea the U.S.
could be so inept. We assumed your semiconductor people, like your baseball
teams, were major league.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was right about that part. America fumbled away its lead
by chasing quick profits. While MITI was playing the only way it knew how. Long
term.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can't tell you how much I regret what's happened
since,&quot; he continued, glancing occasionally at the rows of research labs
gliding by on both sides of the roadway. &quot;I now realize that a more
cooperative approach would have worked to everyone's</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>benefit. In
the long run we each need the other. Now, it's going to take plenty of
cooperation to prevent the U.S. from becoming a back office for Matsuo
Noda.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You really think a big MITI move will blow the
whistle?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matthew, the ministry is the closest thing Japan has to
a strategic deterrent. By exploiting it, I will become the Japanese Rosenberg
in the eyes of many, but if I can cause a worldwide scandal, perhaps everyone
here and in the U.S. will start thinking about the implications of Noda's takeover.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Friend, you're throwing your career in front of a
train.&quot; I said it with respect. &quot;Matsuo Noda could eat us both for <i>hors
d'oeuvres</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Us, maybe. But not MITI. At least not
yet.&quot; He smiled. &quot;You know, we Japanese have a tradition of
committing ritual suicide, <i>seppuku</i>, to emphasize a principle. You might
say I'm doing that, but it's only professional <i>seppuku</i>. No unseemly
knives or blood on the tatami.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I understand now why Tam feels about you the way she
does.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matthew.&quot; He spoke quietly. &quot;I am here, you
are there. I think she needs someone she trusts, and you seem to be that person
just now. Stay by her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd like nothing better.&quot; And with that we lapsed
into pensive silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It took only about ten minutes for the drive over to the
laboratory, another structure that could have been a hangar for flying saucers.
Somehow the idea of viewing a sacred relic of Japan's imperial past in this
sci-fi setting was incongruous in the extreme, pure George Lucas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We alighted in the executive parking lot and headed up the
sidewalk together. At the sealed entrance Ken showed his palm to the computer's
eye, a synthetic voice cleared us, and in we went. Waiting on the other side
was a senior staff man who greeted us at the first security check, bowed, and
motioned us to follow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One area of the lab had been cordoned off, top security, with
gun-carrying guards posted about every ten feet. There were also about two
dozen plainclothes types wearing a white armband emblazoned with the Imperial
insignia. Seemed that nobody, but nobody, got close to the Sun Goddess's
sidearm without clearance from the top.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The staff man said Noda was currently tied up in a meeting</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>with the
director, so we should wait. No need, I said, flashing my DNI meishi. He bowed
and we were waved past the guards, then ushered directly into the top-security
workroom—where the team of white-frocked technicians was said to be cleaning
and retouching the gilding on the sword's <i>tsuba </i>hand guard, the
decorative little disc that separates the hilt from the blade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since the <i>tsuba</i> on swords were interchangeable, not
necessarily connected in any particular way to a given piece, they're actually
a separate art form, interesting but not overly serious items. Fact is, the
Imperial Household could just as well have sent this one up here for work and
kept the sword in Tokyo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Such, however, was not the case. The main attraction itself
was undoubtedly over there on the back workbench, in a big stainless steel box
half the size of a coffin, an armed guard stationed next to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda must have told everybody we were coming in today because
the technicians parted like the Red Sea at our approach. Although the president
of Dai Nippon was still nowhere to be seen, the <i>tsuba</i> was there all
right, lying exposed on a worktable right next to a pile of cleaning pads and
the gilding apparatus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And it was a stunner, take my word. One of the most tasteful
I've ever had the pleasure to view. Iron, of course, and about ten centimeters
across, circular. Actually it was shaped like a chrysanthemum, with the raised
image of a mirror on one side and a beaded necklace on the other. The exquisite
metalwork was enhanced by the fresh gilding, which made the embossing even more
striking. My unprofessional opinion? Very, very ancient. Older than twelfth
century? Entirely possible. I really couldn't say. But a wild guess would be
early Heian, certainly no later than Kamakura. Fact is, back in those days
metalwork didn't change all that much for long periods of time, so there's no
real way to date with precision.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Hijo-ni omoshiroi desu</i>&quot;—very interesting—I
said after a respectful interval, hoping to get into the spirit of the occasion
and impress everybody with my Berlitz Japanese. &quot;And now, would it be
possible to see the actual sword?&quot; I pointed toward the stainless steel
coffin. &quot;Sealed in there, I presume.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The head technician bowed and suddenly looked very troubled.
Then he mumbled something in rapid Japanese to Asano. He didn't budge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Problem?&quot; I turned to Ken.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He says Matsuo Noda has given strict orders that the
sword is never to be viewed by the public when disassembled.&quot; He shrugged.
&quot;Noda-sama, he says, has declared it to be sacred and therefore it must be
displayed with the proper ceremonial reverence always. Of course we'll still be
able to see it, but only after the <i>tsuba</i> is replaced. Perhaps later on
this afternoon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We'd come all this way, and now we were going to be
stymied by some middle-management lab technician?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course&quot;—I bowed back, hoping to
bluff—&quot;weren't you informed why we are here? I have the honor to be Matsuo
Noda's senior American corporate counsel. Noda-sama has ordered me to check and
make certain the hilt remains in place while the <i>tsuba</i> is undergoing
repair. So if you'll kindly open the case, I'll verify that and the matter will
be ended.&quot; I bowed again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>So desu</i>.&quot; He turned pale. Obviously the
grip had been removed. Whoops. I'd just bungled, creating a problem worse than
the one I wanted to circumvent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;On the other hand,&quot; I continued quickly, trying to
recoup, &quot;as long as it's locked in the case, I'm sure there'll be no
problem.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Again he bowed, looking relieved. Noda had these guys scared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;However, it will be necessary to actually see the
sword, so I can report to Noda-sama that I have carried out his instructions.
Otherwise Noda-sama may be upset, and I will be deeply dishonored.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Couching the ploy in personal terms seemed to tip the scale.
He bowed again, hesitantly, then led us over to the box. Throughout my little
white lie, Ken hadn't said one word. Guess he was as curious as I was to take a
look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you realize what you are about to witness?&quot; The
senior staff man stood before us, his dark eyes haughty and grave. Time to put
the barbarian gaijin in his place. &quot;Physical proof of the divinity of His
Imperial Highness, the Emperor of Japan. This sword is the most sacred object
in the world.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I nodded reverently and moved to the side to let the head
technician begin. He slipped a magnetic card into the handle of the steel case,
punched in some electronic numbers on a pad there next to the latch, and slowly
raised the lid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since photographs of the sword had been officially forbidden
by the Imperial Household, I'd not seen even so much as a snapshot. Ken and I
were literally holding our breath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The interior of the coffin had been partitioned into a front
and rear section, both draped with satin. First he lifted away the back
shroud—to reveal a long gold box. That, I figured, must be the watertight case
Noda's scientists had originally detected. Ken emitted a low hum as we looked
at it. Gleaming, the purest of the pure, it had to be 24-karat, like something
you'd find in the tomb of a pharaoh. Along the sides were some elegant, playful
Heian-style reliefs. Birds, musical instruments, Shinto goddesses.
Breathtaking, that's the only word I can find.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's beautiful.&quot; I was staring, dazzled. &quot;And
the sword?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The technician hesitated. Guess we still had him worried.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm sure Noda-sama will be pleased to know of your
cooperation,&quot; I said soothingly. &quot;There should be no
difficulty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He got the message. We weren't going to rock the boat. <i>Wa</i>.
Harmony.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He nodded again, reassured, then reached down and lifted away
the satin cloth covering the front section. Underneath was a bolster of deep
purple velvet, and nestled in the middle was . . . the Imperial Sword.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ken emitted a quiet, reverent exclamation, the hissed
Japanese &quot;<i>Saaaa</i>&quot; that denotes pensive regard, and for a second
we both just stood there. Dr. Kenji Asano was clearly awestruck. I was too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As well we should have been. For one thing, it was a superbly
well-preserved piece. The blade was delicately curved, and its edge could
probably still do damage. A few flecks of rust were visible here and there, but
overall it was in mint condition, just as Noda had claimed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Even more interesting was that, sure enough, the grip had
been removed while they worked on the <i>tsuba</i>. So we were being treated to
a glimpse of the Sacred Sword the way Noda had specified it should never be
viewed—except by a few crew-cut technicians there in the lab—with the <i>nakago</i>,
the steel beneath the grip, exposed. We were seeing it all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It's gratifying to report that his publicity people had told
the truth: there was indeed no signature on the <i>nakago</i>. (I guess if
you're swordsmith for god, you just naturally go easy on the ego.) That
omission notwithstanding, it was definitely a first-class <i>katana</i>. Looked
to be some kind of off-alloy, heavy on copper. If you had to guess what the
early swords were like, say at a time in between the late-bronze and early-iron
ages, this would be a knowledgeable estimate for appearance. The alloy was
plausible; it was clearly very old; and with an antique hilt such as the one
lying there, the overall look was very reasonable. I was impressed. Put the
handle back on the way you normally see a sword and everything about it
clicked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sorry, but out of habit I have to do something now. What
follows is a technical description of the Imperial Sword, including the part
usually hidden by the grip—which nobody else has been able to supply because
nobody else had seen it disassembled as it was there in the lab. There may be
some collectors who'd feel cheated by anything less. This was, as the senior
staff man had sternly brought to our attention, a once-in-a-lifetime moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Early Shinto <i>katana</i>. Very long and active <i>sunagashi
</i>and <i>utsuri </i>extending into a <i>kaen boshi</i>. Slender <i>nakago </i>with
one <i>mekugi-ana</i>. Shallow <i>koshi-zori </i>with <i>chu-kissaki </i>and <i>bo-hi
</i>along either <i>shinogi </i>extending into the <i>nakago </i>. . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Enough. Actually, that last part made me a little sad. Truthfully,
I think Noda was absolutely right. Nobody should sully the divinity of this
piece by exhibiting it disassembled, with the grip removed. The problem is that
anybody with the slightest experience might possibly have his faith shaken a
trifle, since it's common knowledge that a tapered <i>nakago</i>, the sloping
edge there extending back into the section normally covered by the hilt, didn't
come into its own till around the mid fif—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton, I hadn't expected you until later. You
should have contacted me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was the voice of Matsuo Noda, directly behind me. I looked
up to notice that the faces of all the technicians around the room now matched
their bleached lab coats.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Guess we need to coordinate better.&quot; I turned
around and smiled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Walton, I lectured myself, don't be a smartass, just this
once. Be reverent. Who the hell knows how the Sun Goddess liked her <i>nakagos</i>
tapered?</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Besides, the simple truth was the Imperial Sword of
Emperor Antoku really knocked me over. Superb workmanship, excellent balance,
elegant shape. And overall, surprisingly good condition   . . . well, except
for one thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's almost perfect.&quot; I revolved back to examine
it. &quot;Except for that little scratch on the <i>nakago</i>. Too bad.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;What scratch, Mr. Walton?&quot; He stared
down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's actually on the other side as best I recall.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There followed a long pause as Noda's eyes gradually narrowed
to slits. Finally he said, &quot;I wasn't aware you were so conversant with
press descriptions of the sword, Mr. Walton.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We both knew the scratch on the <i>nakago</i>, on the side
not showing, had never once been mentioned in the papers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which was as it should be. A minor blemish really. All the
same I now felt very guilty about it. I do hope it was an unavoidable accident,
like the metallurgy guys at the Princeton lab claimed in the apology that
accompanied their bill after I shipped it down last summer for tests.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was turning out to be quite a day. Seems New York's
crime statistics were looking up; a theft had actually been solved. The son of
a bitch was MINE.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah, well, Mr. Walton, I trust you are suitably
impressed all the same.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Only you could appreciate how much.&quot; My head was
swimming. Judging from the surrounding technicians' reverent gaze, I got the
definite impression they had totally missed the significance of our exchange.
Kenji Asano was now wearing a pure poker face. What was he thinking?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My own concentration, however, was elsewhere at that
particular instant. The new realization: Matthew Walton is a dead man. As of
this moment. Noda would never let me live to tell what I knew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just then an official wearing some sort of formal-looking
black kimono emblazoned with the <i>kiku</i> crest of the Imperial Household
Agency came walking briskly out of the office behind us. He was carrying a
silver case, about cigar-box size, something etched across its filigreed lid.
He walked over to Noda, bowed deferentially, and settled it on the workbench
next to Kenji Asano's briefcase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nobody paid him much notice, however, since we were all still
admiring the Sacred Sword. Finally my brain started to function. Dates? Right .
. . the night I met Noda . . . which got me out of the house ... his hirelings
cleaned out my office . . . that was about, what, two weeks before the sword
was &quot;discovered.&quot; Perfect. Just enough time to salt the thing in the
Inland Sea, let his high-tech research team fish it up. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The technician bowed to us once more, then started spreading
the satin cloths back over the two compartments. Down came the stainless steel
lid. Click. History time was over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when, finally, Ken looked over and noticed the
silver case. He stared at it, puzzled, then glanced at Noda, for whom it
obviously was intended, and inquired politely concerning what it might be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda cleared his throat, mumbled something about official DNI
business, and started thanking the Household rep who'd brought out the case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>However, the Household man showed his breeding. He picked up
Ken's question, smiled and bowed, then proceeded to explain that it contained
the only copies of DNI's original technical analyses of the sword—X-ray
crystallography scans, nondestructive radiation tests, various scientific data
he didn't actually understand but which had been used by Dai Nippon to
establish the sword's alloy composition and therefore its Sacred authenticity.
These data had been forwarded to the Imperial Household with instructions they
be kept under lock and key. He'd understood all along that they had merely been
on temporary loan to the Emperor, and thus he had no objection now that the
honorable Noda-sama had requested their return for additional study by DNI
scientists. All of Japan was in the debt of the esteemed Matsuo . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kenji Asano turned to stare at me, his eyes gradually filling
with an enormous realization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>You know, I used to have a hobby of reading biographies of
the geniuses who'd come up with the truly original insights of modern times.
How, I puzzled, did they manage it? I mean, did Newton really watch an apple
fall and intuitively sense it was responding to some invisible force? Maybe. Or
how about Einstein's insight that matter and energy are really the same thing?
Or that space can be curved? Whatever happened, they made a connection that
nobody else in history had ever come up with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Who can explain how these breakthroughs happen? They're
always the result of standing off and viewing reality in a wholly new way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With apologies, I've invoked some heavy names. But the point
is, there are transcendental moments when a given set of circumstances is
suddenly seen to fit more than one paradigm of how the universe functions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Standing there looking at the silver case, Kenji Asano saw
the apple fall from the tree. And I was only seconds behind him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>New insight number one: Something very fishy was going on
with the Imperial Sword, something which would not necessarily stand the light
of day. (On that one I was actually several seconds ahead.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Number two: If the truth came out, Japan would be a
laughingstock worldwide. Worse, His Imperial Majesty would have egg all over
his Imperial face. As would Matsuo Noda. Hence the box, having served it's PR
purpose, had to go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Number three: The first two insights pointed to the very real
possibility that Matsuo Noda had long since passed around the bend,
sanity-wise. But whether he had or not, one thing was clear—that silver case
contained everything we needed to nail Dai Nippon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Who knew for sure what was in it. But Ken and I both realized
at that instant the contents had to be pure dynamite.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What happened next I probably wouldn't have believed if I
hadn't been standing there to witness it with my very own eyes. Kenji Asano was
calmly extracting a Peace cigarette from the packet in his left breast pocket
and inserting it in his mouth. Then his right hand came up and out of his
thumbnail flared one of those wooden matches he liked so much.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Asano-san, sumimasen</i>.&quot; The senior staff man
stepped forward and blurted out, &quot;No smoking, please.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sorry,&quot; replied Asano, and he flicked the still
burning match toward the waste bin there at the end of the table— which just
happened to be piled high with the solvent pads they'd been using to scour the <i>tsuba</i>.
A lab can be a dangerous place, and this one was no exception. A microsecond
thereafter the floor was carpeted in flame.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Later I theorized what must have occurred, remembering a
long-ago personal disaster that almost got me kicked out of college. The heavy
aromatic solvent they were using, probably a benzene compound, had vaporized
off the cleaning pads, drifted down over the sides of the container, and was
hovering as an invisible, heavier-than-air cloud just above the floor at</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>knee level.
The exact same thing happened to me once in a Chem 201 lab—during an
after-hours endeavor wherein I was steaming out a twenty-gallon benzene
container preparatory to an experiment on the propensity of brewer's yeast to
convert grape sugar into potable ethanol. The sink happened to be situated next
to a gas-fired hot-water heater—which suddenly kicked on. Next thing I knew,
the heavy fumes around my ankles detonated. Along with the lab fire alarm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That explosion, as this one, was actually minor, mostly
noise, though it sounded like a bomb. The fumes flashed and it was over,
leaving no damage other than to the nervous system of any bystanders. This
time, however, there was an added ingredient. The waste container. It had
become an instant inferno, billowing dark, toxic smoke into the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As yelling lab technicians began rushing in with fire
extinguishers, everybody else was bolting for the exits, including the security
people. All in all, it seemed a reasonably propitious moment to make our own
departure as well, since we'd been the cause of the ruckus. Ken fumbled around
in the smoke now obscuring the workbench till he recovered his briefcase, and
then we headed out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At the door I caught sight of the Household official and
bowed my thanks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Domo arigato gozaimashita</i>. I am deeply honored
by this opportunity to view the Imperial Sword of Emperor Antoku.&quot; I bowed
again. He nodded back and glared at Asano.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd planned to thank Noda too, but he was still in there with
the confusion, undoubtedly standing personal guard over his Sacred Sword. Let
him stay. There was no real danger. The fire should be out in no time. It was
mainly smoke anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ken was also bowing his farewells to one and all. Then, as
though on cue, we both started edging toward the main hallway. By now security
people were running down the corridors and the place was in pandemonium.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When we reached the lobby, I almost wanted to bolt for the
outer door, but we managed to keep our exit dignified, businesslike. Finally as
we cleared the last security checkpoint, I turned to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You really should be more careful with your smokes,
Ken.&quot; I lowered my voice. &quot;Manage to grab it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In my briefcase.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then let's get the hell out of here. Noda's going to
figure out what happened any second now and go totally bananas.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I doubt he will be pleased.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell you one thing, that silver case has got to
disappear, fast. Or we're likely to vanish ourselves. We may anyway.&quot; I
quickened my pace toward the parking lot. &quot;You know, I've got a wild hunch
what's in that box. But whatever it is, I do know for sure we'd better get the
thing somewhere for safekeeping. Quick.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Should we tell Tamara?&quot; He glanced down at the
smoke- smeared briefcase in his hands, as though holding a cobra.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's got to know everything. For her own safety.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matthew,&quot; he said, looking at me. &quot;You're
supposed to be an authority. So tell me the truth. You were behaving strangely
in there. It's a fake, isn't it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, during the Middle Ages about fifty different
monasteries in Europe possessed the authentic, consecrated relic of Christ's
circumcision. Who's to say? Remember Francis Bacon's 'What is truth?' Japan's
emperor is now and forever. That's the only 'truth' that matters.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you saying?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That sword belongs to the people of Japan. Ask them if
it's real.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, you've learned enough about this country to be
able to get your message across without actually spelling it out. Very
Japanese.&quot; He stared at me. &quot;You'll have to concede one thing,
though. Matsuo Noda is an absolute genius. Think about it. He claimed to have
analyzed the sword, then donated the data to the Imperial Household—knowing
there would be only one place on earth where it could be right out in public and
yet never actually examined. In a fancy silver case kept by a bunch of
Household bureaucrats, not one of whom would have the presumption to open it.
Or be able to understand anything if he did.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My own nagging thoughts at that moment were on a different track.
Why had Noda offered to let me see my own piece? To flaunt the dimensions of
his balls? Or was he starting to believe his own trumped-up fantasy? Had Matsuo
Noda convinced himself he was God? That he could turn water into wine? Or a
fifteenth-century metallurgical screw-up into . . . The more I thought about
it, the scarier it got. Or maybe, just maybe, he thought I wouldn't recognize
it with a different hilt. Could be he was right. But Ken and I had accidentally
viewed it disassembled. That wasn't part of his little inside joke. For once
Matsuo Noda had blown it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, everything I've learned about Noda so far tells me
he's going to do something totally unexpected the minute he realizes we took
that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let him. I want to know what's in it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do the world a favor. No. Never, never open it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He paused a second and looked down at his briefcase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe you're right. It's better for everybody if it
just disappears.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By then we'd fully cleared the outer doors. The day was
turning gorgeous, sunny and brisk. The thin film of last night's snow was all
but gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Abruptly he stopped. &quot;Wait, Matthew. Think a minute. We
have to at least make a copy of the contents. And it needs to be gotten out of
Japan.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To protect ourselves?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Precisely.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, I'll buy that. Got any ideas?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, first let's go pick up Tam. Then I'd like to
transmit digital facsimiles of whatever's in here to New York. She can set up a
file in DNI's big NEC mainframe, and only the three of us will know the file
name. It'll be your, and her, insurance policy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can we do that from here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In fifteen minutes. There's the Teleconferencing Center
over next to Electrotechnical. They've got everything we'll need.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then let's collect her and get it done fast.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He opened the door of the Toyota, then turned to me.
&quot;You know, Matthew, I think you and Tam ought to be gone from here, too,
as soon as possible. There's a copter pad by the hotel. I'm going to phone for
a MITI chopper to pick you up and take you straight to Narita.&quot; He patted
his briefcase. &quot;After we've transmitted the contents of this, I want you
back in New York. I'll call my secretary and have her book the next flight out;
we'll just have somebody bumped if it's full.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why don't you come with us? No need for you to face
Noda alone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not yet.&quot; He hit the ignition. &quot;But I'll be
there in spirit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<h4><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</span></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:1.0pt;color:windowtext'><img
width=32 height=33 src="images/image022.jpg" alt=""></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Our major concern at that point was time. We had a lot to do,
and we weren't sure how long we had to do it. Furthermore, it would be
foolhardy to assume everything was going to proceed smoothly. That apprehension
was, in fact, soon to be thoroughly vindicated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>First, it wasn't all that simple to track down Tam. We
finally discovered she'd already left the Robotics Lab and was back at the
Tsukuba Hotel lunching with Matsugami and some of his senior staff. Returning
there, however, did provide a perfect opportunity to grab our bags. Ken dragged
her from the lunch with a phony excuse, and minutes later we were checked out,
solving at least one logistics problem. Unfortunately, it also tipped off
Matsugami and anybody else who might be interested that we were departing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next were the details of arranging for the chopper. While we
were driving around trying to locate Tamara, Ken was busy on his car phone
pulling strings to commandeer one of the two MITI helicopters. After three
calls he managed to locate one at their auxiliary pad, currently being refueled
and serviced. I listened to him lean on the service people, doing his diplomatic
but firm deputy minister routine. End of long story: it would be on its way
shortly, arriving in about an hour and a half.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good, we thought. Plenty of time to handle the transmission
of the still-unseen documents in Noda's silver case. In the car we brought Tam
fully up to date on the extraordinary circumstances by which it had fallen into
our possession, including its potential for use as leverage against Noda. Then
we headed for the Teleconferencing Center, where we planned to open the thing,
scan the contents with a reader, and bounce the pages to New York via
satellite. Ken revealed the ministry had a high-security channel it used to
communicate with the New York offices of JETRO, the Japan External Trade
Organization over on Sixth Avenue, MITI's public relations arm. He declared we
would just link up with that office and have them patch us through to the DNI
computer. Nothing to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which was correct, theoretically. When we marched in, Ken
again flaunting his deputy minister walk-on priority, the white-shirted staff
bowed to the floor, led us to the hard-copy scanner, turned it on, and
diplomatically excused themselves, closing the security door. The place was
ours.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Don't know why, but until that moment none of us had really
wanted to know what was in Noda's case. Maybe a part of me still didn't, even
then. Whatever the reason, however, none of us had bothered to take it out of
Ken's briefcase for examination. Turned out that was a mistake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He settled his satchel onto the desk, clicked it open, and
out came the box for our first real look. As he wiped off the smoke, my initial
reaction was to be dazzled. It was magnificent, a silversmith's masterpiece,
engraved with all manner of mythological beast and fowl. A work of art in every
sense. Never seen anything remotely like it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The problem was, it wasn't merely locked. It was soldered
shut. The silver lid had literally been welded on, leaving it essentially a
solid piece. Noda, it turned out, left nothing to chance. Only a silversmith
could crack the seal and divulge the contents. So we still had no idea what was
inside, and worse, we'd managed to fritter away a valuable half hour coming to
that fruitless discovery. Now what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shit,&quot; said Tam. &quot;When will we ever get a
break?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Looks like we've got two choices,&quot; Ken announced
ruefully, gazing down at the intractable chunk of metal in his hands. &quot;We
can do what we probably should have done in the first place: simply stash this
for the moment and let Noda think we know what's in it. Or we can drive into
Tokyo and locate somebody there who can open it, then transmit from MITI
headquarters downtown.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Neither of these plans seemed particularly inspired. The
first gave us nothing but presumptions for leverage, and the second could take
hours. Noda, we all realized, was not a man who dallied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Actually&quot;—Tam spoke up—&quot;there's a third
option. Surely Noda's going to find out sooner or later we came here to the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Center.
Believe me, he always learns everything eventually. So why not transmit
something else now, anything, and then after you get the case open you can send
the real data?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean, give him circumstantial cause to assume we've
got the goods on him?&quot; Sounded good to me. &quot;Buying ourselves more
time?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right. It'll take him awhile to find out exactly what
was transmitted. All he'll know for certain is that we sent something. In the
meantime Ken can go on to Tokyo and proceed with plan B: open the case there
and transmit the real contents.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked skeptical. &quot;That might deceive everybody for a
while, but not for long. There're too many links in the chain between here and
DNI's New York office.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But sending something now will gain time. It has to.
Then you can go on to Tokyo and do what you need to from there. Tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Maybe.&quot; He still wasn't totally
convinced. &quot;But all right—rather than waste time arguing, let's just go
ahead and do it. No harm in any instance.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She peeked into his briefcase, a jumble of documents.
&quot;What have you got in here that we could send?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Today's <i>Asahi Shimbun </i>. . .&quot; He laughed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Ken.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, okay.&quot; He laid the newspaper aside and was
riffling through his paperwork. &quot;How about a few MITI memos?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing to do with Marketshare - 90, I hope,&quot; said
Tam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Promise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The apparatus was already humming, so he put through the
connection to JETRO's New York office, whereupon Tam took over and gave them
instructions for the phone link over to the DNI mainframe. It probably required
all of a couple of minutes. Welcome to the Brave New World of global
information technology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since we were just shooting in the dark, they transmitted
some twenty or twenty-five pages. Actually it would have been almost better to
send too few rather than too many. At four pages a minute, though, we were
finished in no time. As something of a joke, Tam suggested using the file name
Nipponica, homage to Noda's takeover pipe dream. Somehow it seemed poetic
justice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whether the transparency of our ruse would be immediately
evident to Matsuo Noda remained a big unknown. But . . . maybe Noda would have
no real way of discovering we'd sent garbage, at least not for a while. The
transmission done, we signed off, zipped up Ken's briefcase, and marched out as
if we knew what we were doing. Still, it was only a bluff, and a shaky one at
that. Which set me to thinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, it seems to me yours is the critical path in this
play now.&quot; We were walking back to the executive parking lot where we'd
left his car. &quot;It's more important to have a real copy of the data stashed
somewhere than it is for us to blow the country in the next two hours. Which
means maybe you ought to take the chopper back yourself, send the stuff today,
and let us just drive down to Narita in your car?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I agree.&quot; Tam nodded concurrence. &quot;We can
leave it there and you could have somebody pick it up tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's dangerous, for both of you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe so,&quot; she said, &quot;but he's going to come
after this case, guns blazing, as his first priority. Ken, you're the one who's
going to have to stay out of his way now, not us. The quicker you move, the
better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've got a point. All right, if you want me to, then
I could take the copter back to Tokyo myself and you can use the Toyota.&quot;
He was fishing for his keys. &quot;In fact, maybe you should just leave
now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me check the schedule.&quot; I'd asked his
secretary for a listing of the afternoon and evening flights in case we got
delayed. It was now one-thirty. The next flight that looked like a sure thing
was a United at seven forty-two, or maybe the JAL at nine. Then there was a
Northwest at ten-fifteen. Loads of time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, we can wait for the chopper and at least see you
off. Why don't we head back over to the hotel and have a drink. Solemnize the
occasion—the final nailing of Matsuo Noda.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fine.&quot; He started the car. &quot;But both of you
get only one, at least whoever's driving does. I want you back in one
piece.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The hotel bar was beginning to feel like a second home,
though now it was deserted, the lunch trade long departed. Our ceremonial
libation also provided my first real opportunity to study Ken Asano at leisure.
I sat sipping my Suntory while he repeated once again the details of his
upcoming political move at MITI. Given any kind of luck, the flap would render
Noda's takeover a worldwide scandal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good. Tam and I had been Noda's point men, had done
everything we knew to assist him, and now it was clear he'd been using us all
along for his own ends. He was bent on bringing American industry back to life
for the sole purpose of skimming the cream.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What other reason could there be? Noda's noble intention
supposedly was to help rejuvenate those American corporations doing basic
research—but the price was then to let Japan lift that R&amp;D and translate it
into consumer technology, thereby keeping for his team all the elements of real
economic value in the chain from laboratory to cash register. They would be the
ones refining their strategic capacity to transform new ideas into world-class
products and economic leadership. Japan would retain the advanced engineering
segment of product development, while tossing a few low-skill assembly plants
to the U.S. to make us think we were still part of the action. It would, of
course, be a fatal delusion. The high-tech hardware of tomorrow's world
increasingly would be Japanese, while America became an economy of
paper-shuffling MBAs and low-paid grease monkeys assembling products we no
longer were able to design or engineer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That depressing conclusion required the space of one Scotch.
By then I was ready to order a second, hoping it would bring forth a solution
to the problem the first had evoked with such alarming clarity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But there wasn't time. At that moment we heard the MITI
copter settling onto the pad next to the hotel parking lot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, here's to success.&quot; I saluted him with the
last melting ice cubes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He toasted back, then signaled for the bill. Time to get
moving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The chopper was a new Aerospatiale AS 365N Twin Dauphin, big
and white, a VIP four-seater. Single pilot, capable of 180. (The Japanese love
those high-rotor French copters.) Guess Ken had called in a lot of chips to
arrange this customized three-wheeler for a couple of<i> gaijin</i>. The
seat-mile costs alone must have been staggering. But there it was, fully
serviced and set to go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He walked over, ducking the rotor, and advised the pilot that
there had been a slight change of plans. They'd be returning directly back to
Tokyo. The man, wearing a blue uniform, bowed and gave him a little salute.
They seemed to be old friends. Well, I thought, if deputy ministers don't use
this gold-plated extravagance, then who's it for?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he returned to pick up his briefcase (Noda's silver box
safely therein), have a brief farewell, and give us his keys.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tamara, telex me the minute you get back. We'll proceed
immediately. Full speed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's go for it.&quot; She smiled and drew his face
down for a long, languorous kiss. I then shook his hand, and we headed for the
car. Since our bags were just little carry-ons, we looked solid to catch the
United flight with a couple of hours to spare, assuming traffic cooperated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, how about taking the wheel? This left-hand-side-of-
the-road driving takes practice. I almost hit somebody once in England.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sure.&quot; She reached for the keys, then turned back
to wave to Ken. But he was already climbing aboard and didn't notice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Isn't it odd?&quot; I mused, &quot;We still haven't
heard zip out of Noda. He must have realized by now we have his silver case.
What's he planning to do? Where'll he try to head us off?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good question.&quot; She turned the key in the
ignition. &quot;I'm not going to feel safe till we've got the actual goods on
his phony sword. Not just some dummy data.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My guess is he'll try and nail us at the airport. It'd
be his best shot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;At least Ken was smart enough to make the reservations
under fake names, so he won't know which flight to watch.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There're not that many. He could be covering them all.
On the other hand, he'll assume we're arriving via the MITI chopper, so maybe
we can dodge his hit squad.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I feel like I've been run through a wringer.&quot; She
was pulling out of the slot, backing around to begin making her way through the
rows of staff vehicles, all with special Tsukuba parking stickers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You can say that again. Who could have guessed all the
. . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd reached around to check the back window, hoping to get
the heat going, when my field of vision turned an incandescent orange, bright
and glaring, as though the sun had just come in for a close encounter. Before I
could turn to see what . . . the dashboard rose up and slugged me in the teeth,
as a shock wave flung us both against the seat belts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We're dead, I thought. We've been bombed. Noda's just dropped
. . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I looked up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The MITI Aerospatiale, about two hundred feet off the ground,
had become a blazing sphere, a grotesque nova. Now its rotor blades were
clawing the air, askew, while it circled downward like a wounded bird. An
instant later it nosed into the parking lot behind us, hurtling fragments of
tail assembly through several empty staff cars.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I sat mesmerized as a second ball of fire erupted where it
had crashed. One of the fuel tanks had ignited, just like in the movies. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken!&quot; Tam let out a choked cry after the first few
seconds of disbelief. Then she slammed the transmission into 'Park' and began
ripping off her seat belt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where's she going? Doesn't she realize—?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her door was open and she was stumbling out. That's when I
finally came to my senses, which included the sobering thought that there might
be more fuel tanks, such as the auxiliary, that hadn't yet blown.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Wait!&quot; I'd ripped off my own seat harness by that
time and had rolled out to begin running after her as she stumbled across the
snowy stretch of asphalt separating us from the flames.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was moving like a gazelle, but I managed to catch up
about thirty yards from the wreckage. Using a modified shoulder block, I pulled
her around and tried to get a grip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, nobody could survive that. We've got to stay back
. . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At which point we both slipped and collapsed in a patch of
snow . . . just as the last fuel tank detonated with the impact of a sonic
boom. Memory can be a little unreliable under such circumstances, but I still
remember more wreckage sailing past us, including a strut off the landing gear
that gouged a furrow in the asphalt no more than ten feet from our heads.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, he never knew what hit him. It had to be
instantaneous.&quot; I was trying to brush the wet snow off her face as I
slipped my arm around her shoulders. She was still holding back the tears, but
only just.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We didn't even have a real good-bye.&quot; Her words
were jagged. &quot;There were so many things . . . I was hoping we . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her voice trailed off into tears.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, I only knew him for a day, but that was enough to
learn some things. Kenji Asano was a wise and noble soul. Everything about him
was good.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She took my hand and held it against her cheek. &quot;Matt,
he was so kind. That was what . . . He was . . . all that I . . .&quot; Her
eyes were reflecting back the flames, now billowing into the pale afternoon
sky. Around us the labs were emptying as technicians raced toward the lot,
white coats fluttering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, he said something to me today. About you . .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot; She glanced up, her face streaked.
&quot;What did he</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>say?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He must have known there was danger. He sort of asked
me to look out for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Danger?&quot; She looked back at the wreckage, and a
new tear trailed down her left cheek. &quot;I guess we don't really know for
sure, do we? Maybe it was just a fuel tank rupture, or . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You don't believe that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No.&quot; The tears, abruptly, were gone. &quot;Matsuo
Noda just took away the one . . . Matt, I'm going to kill him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was a sentiment I shared in buckets. The question was
merely how. Medieval torture seemed too kind. I started to say something inane,
and then, finally, the shocking truth landed with the force of that last
explosion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, that was supposed to be us.&quot; I was gazing at
the flames, watching talons of metal contort in the heat. &quot;Noda thought we
were going to be on that copter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My God, of course.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We've got to get out of here. Now. There's nothing
anybody can do for Ken.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not leaving till I've settled the score.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Be reasonable. There's no way we can do it here. This
is Noda's turf.&quot; I was urging her to her feet. &quot;We'll find a way. All
I ask is that he know we were the ones who did him in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But how can we just leave?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What else are we supposed to do? There's nothing
left.&quot; I tried to take her hand. &quot;Come on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She finally relented and, with one last tearful stare, turned
to follow me back to the car. By then a crowd of technicians was surging in
around us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ken's blue Toyota was still running. Without a word she
buckled in, shoved the stick into gear, and turned for the exit, whereupon she
barely avoided colliding with the first racing fire engine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, are you okay? I can drive if you . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, don't say anything more, please.&quot; The tears
had vanished. &quot;Can I just think for a while? Just give me some quiet to
think.&quot; She was gripping the wheel with raw anger. &quot;Please.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've got it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By the time we reached the highway, she was driving
mechanically but with absolute precision, almost as though tragedy had somehow
sharpened her reflexes, her logical processes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It's a curious thing, but different people respond
differently to disaster, and Tam was one of those rare few who become harder,
not softer. I could see it in her eyes. As the minutes ticked by, and we
reached the packed thoroughfare that would take us south, it even got to be a
little unsettling. What in hell was going through her head?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally, after about an hour of bumper-to-bumper freeways, I
couldn't take the silence any more. Without asking anybody's permission, I
reached over and clicked on the radio. It was set for a classical station, the
music Chopin. Was this Ken's regular fare? I wondered. Was he a romantic at
heart or a classicist? Guess I'd never know . . . that, or much of anything
else about him. Which thought brought with it a renewed sadness. Kenji Asano
was a man of the East who was as much of the West as anybody I'd ever met in
Japan. I'd wanted him for a friend.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When you get to be my age, you don't make too many new
friends, not real ones. After forty, it's acquaintances. The roots of true
friendship extend so deep that there's never really time to plant them if you
start too late. Maybe it's because there's always a part missing, that shared
experience of being young and crazy and broke. Those times back when you both
still believed anything was possible. New friends can't begin sentences with
&quot;Remember that weekend before you were married when we got drunk and . .
.&quot; Getting old is tough, and that's one of the toughest parts. But somehow
I felt, with Ken, that I'd known him forever. Could be that's absurd, but I
really did. So quite apart from the tragedy of his death, I felt cruelly
robbed. It sounds selfish, maybe, but it's the truth. A sad but true truth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I was still thinking those thoughts when the four-o'clock
newscast came on. For a moment neither of us noticed, but then Tam snapped
alert and turned up the volume. The report was opening with a live remote from
Tsukuba Science City. I couldn't really follow very well, but she realized that
and began to translate as it went along.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;. . . was the first tragedy of its kind for the
ministry, and there are widespread calls for an official inquiry. Dr. Kenji
Asano, nationally known director of The Institute for New Generation Computer
Technology, died today here at Tsukuba Science City when a MITI helicopter, an
Aerospatiale Twin Dauphin, crashed due to a malfunction. No cause has yet been
ascertained for the accident, which also took the life of the pilot, Yuri
Hachiro, a MITI veteran with fifteen years of service. The condition of the
wreckage has made it impossible to determine how many other passengers may have
been on board, although MITI sources report that two visiting American
scientists are also thought to have been traveling with Dr. Asano. Their names
are being withheld by the ministry at this time, pending the completion of a
full investigation. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next came an interview with a MITI official, after which the
reporter offered a wrap-up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;. . . believe Dr. Asano's death represents a
significant blow to several vital sectors of MITI's computer race with America.
However, the vice minister has assured NHK that MITI's research effort will
redouble its commitment to . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam clicked it off. &quot;Two birds with one stone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, by bringing down the 'copter with all three of us
in it, he was planning to stop MITI and us both. Now he may think he did.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're right.&quot; I looked at her, and finally
understood the real import of the crash. &quot;Which means we're now officially
dead. If nobody else knows we weren't on that chopper, why would Noda?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She didn't answer for a long moment. Finally she said,
&quot;Maybe that gives us the time we'll need.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Time to nail him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right. I've been thinking. About what it all
means.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Noda's play?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not just that. I'm talking about Japan. Everything. You
know, this country could lead the world someday, maybe even now, if it wanted.
It has the finest schools, the most disciplined people; it's not hung up on a
lot of 'superpower' male-macho bullshit. It could be a beacon in the dark, a
force for good. But what has Noda done? He's turned it all upside down. He's
exploited the noble things about Japan for his own selfish ends. Greed and
power.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Lucifer, the fallen angel. Who walked out on the
Kingdom?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I guess so. But I'm also thinking about what he did to
me. He exploited the fact I was part Japanese, that I understand the potential
this country has. He made me think that's what I would be helping him realize.
But all along he intended to pervert it. He's perverted us, Matthew. Both of
us. Perverted us and used us. And now that we're no longer needed, he's tried
to kill us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;High time we evened things out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damned right. I learned a lot when I lived here. About
the Japanese mind. And you understand legal tactics. Swordsmanship. I think
we're ready.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ready?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To turn our knowledge against him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Start probing for the niche in his armor?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No. There's no time for that.&quot; She was silent for
a moment, as though preparing her words. &quot;We've got to just sink him.
Obliterate Dai Nippon totally. And with it Matsuo Noda.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean . . . go public about the sword? The problem
with that is . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Exactly. Everything's destroyed. So why not forget
about the sword for a while? Whatever you know about it, at this point that's
just your word against his. I mean we have to bring the whole thing down.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, we're talking billions of dollars. This could take
a while. That number is a little hard to argue with.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what if that's both his strength and his
weakness.&quot; She glanced over at me. &quot;Look, I've been thinking about
what we might try. Maybe there is a way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To assault him on the money front?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right, but we'll need your friend Bill Henderson. Think
he'd help?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I nodded. &quot;If you want him, I'll see that he pitches
in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good.&quot; She turned her eyes back to the road.
&quot;Matt, I'm</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Fujiwara.
Did I ever tell you that? And a Fujiwara's duty is to protect the emperor of
Japan. For a thousand years it's been their job.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She'd cracked. Begun talking gibberish. &quot;What's that got
to do with—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Noda thinks he's going to exploit the Emperor. Well,
he's got a big surprise in store. I am now going to use Dai Nippon to destroy
him and then drive a stake into DNI's heart. Matthew, I'm going to make Matsuo
Noda's billions just disappear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's impossible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

TWENTY-FIVE</span></a></h5>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:1.0pt;color:windowtext'><img

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Guess Tam's Shinto <i>kami </i>were on our side, since we
made it through Narita Airport with no hassles; or maybe being dead keeps you
off anybody's hit list. Now that MlTI was determined not to release our names
until they located our remains, we looked to be in limbo as far as Matsuo Noda
and Dai Nippon were concerned. Given the fact the chopper had been demolished
and then burned down to metal, nobody knew anything. Yet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The scenario Tam laid out on the 747 flying back, while we
drank a lot of airline cognac in the upstairs lounge, was destined to be yet
another first in the annals of American finance, one way or the other. If we
bungled it—and lived to face the consequences—would we end up like those
grim-faced executives you see being hustled into the federal courthouse
downtown, flanked by G-men in cheap trench coats? Later, eyeing the network
cameras, we'd have to smile bravely and declare that American justice, in which
we had full confidence, would surely vindicate us after all the facts, etc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>To go with her play meant we were headed either for the
history books or jail, or both. But we would definitely need</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Henderson
and his &quot;Georgia Mafia.&quot; My questions were actually pretty simple:
(1) Could it be done, and if so, (2) how and how fast?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We got back Monday, the day before New Year's, and the first
person I called after Amy was Henderson, casually mentioning that something
potentially very disrupting to the Street was in the works.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bill, fasten your seat belt. Bumpy weather ahead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That captured his attention in a flash. What in hell, he
inquired, was I talking about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We need to get together, tonight.&quot; I continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How about you</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>r place</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>?
Matter of fact, there's a real question just now, at least in Japan, concerning
whether Tam and I are actually alive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Walton, what in God's name is going on?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In the fullness of time, friend, all things will be
known. Now we see as through a glass darkly . . . well, actually we're seeing
through the smudgy windows of the Plaza, suite three twenty-five, where we're
presently holed up. But we've got to stay low profile for a few more
days.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Whatever you say,&quot; he replied, still puzzled.
&quot;Then how about dropping by here tonight for a quick one, and then
afterward we can all mosey over to Mortimer's on Lex for a quick bite?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay. As long as we go late. I want to miss the
happy-hour crowd.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This did not please him, but he agreed. My suspicions were he
wanted to use the occasion to reconnoiter the glittery, jet-set ladies at the
bar. Henderson, whose style and drawl undoubtedly distinguished him from the
B-school competition there like a white-maned palomino in a herd of draft
horses (investment drones who wore a beeper on their belt and used
&quot;bottom-line&quot; as a verb), surely found the place a fertile hunting
ground. Mortimer's was custom-made for his idiosyncratic style.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>About nine that evening Tam and I slipped out of the Plaza's
Fifty-ninth Street entrance and headed up Fifth Avenue toward Bill's. He was
headquartered in one of those solid, granite-faced buildings near the
Metropolitan that are constructed like small fortresses—presumably so New
York's upper one tenth of one percent can repel the long-feared assault of the
homeless hordes at their feet. In the lobby, Henderson vouched for us over the
TV intercom, after which we were given a visual search by the doorman, his
uniform a hybrid of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan and crypto-Nazi, and shown the
elevator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A quick doorbell punch and the man from Georgia greeted us,
Scotch in hand. His little pied-a-terre was about three thousand square feet of
knee-deep carpets, Old Masters (I loved the Cezanne and the Braque), and
masculine leather furniture. A padded wet bar, complete with mirror and a bank
of computer monitors—for convenient stock action—stretched across one side of
the living room, while the sliding glass doors opposite faced onto a balcony
that seemed suspended in midair over Central Park. While Tam, with her
designer's eye, was complimenting him politely on the understated elegance of his
Italian wallpaper, French art, and English furniture, I tried not to remember
all those early years back in New Haven when his idea of decor was a feed-store
calendar featuring a bluetick hound.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Although the balcony doors were open, the living room still
had the acrid ambience of a three-day-old ashtray. He poured us a drink from a
half-gallon of Glenfiddich on the bar, gestured us toward the couch, and
offered Havana cigars from a humidifier. I took him up on it, out of olfactory
self-defense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So tell me, ladies and gents, what's the latest?&quot;
He settled  himself in the leather armchair and plopped his boots onto an
antique ottoman. &quot;How're the Jap assault forces doing these days? They
gonna take over the Pentagon next?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not that we've heard.&quot; I was twisting my Havana
against the match. &quot;Though it might reduce procurement costs on toilet
seats and ashtrays if they did.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Henderson sipped at his drink, then his tone heavied up.
&quot;Who are we kidding, friends. My considered reading of the situation is
your boys on Third Avenue are unstoppable. They can do whatever they damn well
please from here on out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's not necessarily in everybody's best interest,
Bill.&quot; I strolled over to look down at the park. &quot;Got any new
thoughts?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can't say as I do. Our IBM play didn't get to first
base; Noda saw us coming a mile away. Thank God I didn't get in deep enough to
get hurt.&quot; He leaned back. &quot;What makes it so damned frustrating is
the market's tickled as a pig in shit. Ain't nobody too interested in dissuading
your friends from buying up everything in sight. Street's never seen anything
like this kind of bucks before. It's a whole new ball game downtown.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's right, Bill,&quot; I mused aloud. &quot;The
question is, whose ball game is it?&quot; Tam still hadn't said anything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damned good question. What happens when foreigners
start owning your tangible assets? The answer, friend, is they end up owning <i>you</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Henderson, all that could be about to
change.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Says who?&quot; He leaned back. &quot;Looks to me like
Noda's going all the way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bill, let's talk one of those hypothetical scenarios
you like so much. What if Dai Nippon suddenly had a change of plans? Switched
totally? And instead of buying, they started selling?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That pulled him up short. He even set down his glass.
&quot;Come again?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Call it a hypothetical proposition. I'm asking what
would happen on the Street if Dai Nippon decided, unannounced, to make a
significant alteration in its portfolio? All of a sudden started divesting?
Massively.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When'd this happen!&quot; He squinted. &quot;How much
action we looking at?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I didn't want to say it for fear he might need CPR for his
heart. Finally Tam set down her drink and answered him. &quot;All of it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Christ.&quot; He went pale. &quot;What's that add up
to, total?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We figure it'd run to several hundred billion,&quot; I answered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He sat there in confusion. &quot;Over what kind of time
period?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's part of the reason we wanted to see you. If,
strictly as a hypothesis, they were to do something like that, as fast as
possible, how long would it take? Just throw your hat at the number, wild
guess.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Time, you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Exactly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, let's look at it a second here. I'd guesstimate
that all the exchanges together—Big Board, American, Merc, CBOT, NASDAQ,
Pacific, the rest—probably have a dollar volume upwards of . . . how many billions
a day? Say twenty billion, easy, maybe more, the way volume's climbing. But
that figure's purely hypothetical. If Dai Nippon dumped all those securities on
the table at once, the value of their portfolio would go to hell.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I glanced at Tam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's how we see it too,&quot; she said. And nothing
more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you two suggesting?&quot; He was visibly
rattled. &quot;Noda'd never pull anything that crazy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bill, with all due respect, let's proceed one step at a
time here with this hypothesis,&quot; I went on. &quot;Assuming, just for
purposes of discussion, he did decide to do something like that, unload
everything, what's the fastest way?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hell, I'd have to think.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on, man. Financial derring-do is your special
trade,&quot; I pressed him. &quot;What if DNI's mainframe was used to set up a
global trading network? Began dumping worldwide?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, that'd probably be the quickest approach.&quot;
He was slowly coming awake. &quot;Jesus Christ! It's not Noda we're talking
about.&quot; He looked at me, then at Tam. &quot;It's you. You're going to try
and . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Possibly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then we sure as hell are talking theory, 'cause you'd
never be able to do anything like that without Noda's gettin' wind of it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Henderson, as usual you're not listening. Plausibility
is not the topic under discussion. Right now we're looking at the impact.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, you'd damned well better start with some
plausibility.&quot; He settled back. &quot;Say you could get around Noda. The
next problem is, the minute word hits the Street DNI's dumping, all hell's
liable to break loose. It'd be front page. And first thing you know, the
market's going to be headed the wrong way. If you've got a heavy block of
shares you want to divest, you damn well do it on the QT, 'cause its price can
start to nosedive. Folks tend to figure you know something they don't. The
Street's about ninety percent psychology and ten percent reality . . . if that
much.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just concentrate on the technical part,
Henderson.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, friends, any way you cut it, we're talking what
I'd call a very dubious proposition. Those Jap institutions would lose their
shirt if DNI dumped all at once.&quot; He exhaled quietly. &quot;You start
rolling billions and billions in Japanese money, how you plan on keeping the
thing from blowing sky-high? You'd have Nips climbing all over your ass in ten
minutes flat, you tried something like that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Henderson, relax. What if we did it anonymously? Like I
said. Used the DNI mainframe, funneled orders through accounts everywhere,
dummy accounts in banks all over the place? Wouldn't that give us some elbow
room?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe, maybe. If you played it right. I'd guess a few
wise guy analysts would probably sniff something in the wind, but nobody'd have
a handle on the real action, at least not for a while. Things might stay cool
temporarily.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you saying that, in theory, the market side is
doable, at least initially?&quot; Tam pressed him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm just guessing it's vaguely conceivable.&quot; He
got up to freshen his drink. &quot;Be that as it may, though, the real problem
is the Japanese end. I'd guess the shit's going to be all over the fan in Tokyo
the minute you start selling. Those pension funds are not going to roll over
and let you wreck their portfolio.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bill&quot;—I spoke up—&quot;they're not going to be
able to stop us. Count on it. DNI holds the stock as trustee. Noda's rules.
Ironclad power of attorney.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So,&quot; I said very carefully, &quot;we are going to
take over Dai Nippon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What the hell are you talking about!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We told him. The Rambo part.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jeezus!&quot; He stared at the two of us. &quot;What
you're proposing is a major felony. I could get accessory and five years for
just listening to this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who's going to file charges?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How about Mr. Matsuo Noda for starters?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bill, we just happen to have a little leverage with Mr.
Noda-san at the moment. The minute he finds out we're still alive—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'd damned well better, or you could be looking at a
long interlude of pastoral delights up at the Danbury country club.&quot; He
was still dumbstruck. Finally he grinned. &quot;After parole, though, you could
probably sell your memoirs to Newsweek for a couple of million and land a guest
slot on Carson.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a long pause as silence filled the room, broken
only by the distant sound of a siren from the street below. For a minute I had
the paranoid fantasy it was the first wave of the police SWAT team heading
downtown to shoot it out with us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally Bill turned back and fixed me with a questioning
look. &quot;Are you really serious about this asshole idea?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's not without appeal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Walton, you dumb fuck, do this and you'll never work in
this town again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm well aware of that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nobody'd hire you to fight a dog summons, let alone a
takeover.&quot; Bill turned to Tam. &quot;Talk sense to this man.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It was my idea.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're both crazy.&quot; He walked over to the bar and
poured some more Scotch into his glass. &quot;But what the hell. I've seen enough
to know we'd damned sure better start taking this country back into our own
hands one way or another.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So you'll help?&quot; She was watching him like a hawk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, now, what's life for, gentle lady&quot;—he
grinned—&quot;except to kick ass now and again. Somebody's got to throw a
monkey wrench into Noda's operation. If you think you can do it, then count me
in. If nothing else, maybe we can cause a few waves down on the Potomac.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What am I hearing? I found myself wondering. Dr. William J.
Henderson, capitalism's pillar of sober reappraisal, entertaining a scenario
straight from a CIA handbook?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Of course, Bill still hadn't heard the second half of the
play.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fine, we could use your help on the setup.&quot; I
glanced at the row of CRT screens behind the bar. &quot;First there's the
matter of getting control of DNI's supercomputer, and then we'll need somebody
with trading experience. Is there any chance you could bring in one of your
boys to oversee that end?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How do you figure on running it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd guess our best shot is to stay off-exchange as much
as possible. Use Jeffries, third-market outfits like that. And also keep the
money offshore, international, with a lot of separate bank connections to
handle the transfers. Maybe also float some of the interim liquidity in overnight
paper to cover our tracks, just so we can generally keep the lid on everything
as long as we can.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then it so happens one of my boys might just fill our
bill. That's his thing. He operates freelance now, but he's good. Damned good.
Trouble is, he knows it, and he don't come cheap anymore.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think we can cover a few consulting fees. Can he keep
his mouth shut?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If he couldn't, we'd both probably be in jail by
now.&quot; He drained his glass. &quot;Though remember, you'll be moving a lot
of bucks, and there are folks who keep track of such things. But I know a few
smokescreens that'll hold the SEC and that crowd at arm's length for a
little.&quot; He looked at me for a second, his face turning quizzical.
&quot;What was that you said just now? About parking the money overnight? What
are you going to do with it after that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're getting ahead of things,&quot; Tam replied
calmly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bill, why don't we head on over to Mortimer's?&quot; I
looked out at the park one last time. &quot;You may need a stiff drink for the
rest of this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Bushido. Take it apart, <i>bu-shi-do</i>, and you have
&quot;military- knight-ways,&quot; the rules of chivalry that governed every
moment of a samurai's existence. This code of honor of the warrior class, this
noblesse oblige, was also known as 'the way of the sword.' For a samurai the
sword was a sacred icon, an emblem of strength and inner resolve. Casual
handling was unheard of. You never stepped over a sword, you never treated it
with insouciance or irreverence. It was an extension of your character. A
samurai regarded his <i>katana</i> as the symbol of his caste: a weapon, yes,
but also a constant reminder of who he was, his obligations as well as his
rights.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which was why I needed the prize of my collection in hand
when we entered our final battle with Dai Nippon. I wanted to face Matsuo Noda
with classic dignity, with the Japanese honor he had scorned, to let him know
he had a worthy opponent, one who understood the meaning of <i>bushido</i>. I
also wanted in that process to stick those DNI guards' Uzis up their ass. I'd
be needing a <i>katana</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Our meeting with Henderson was Monday night. Tuesday
morning we all buckled down and began working around the clock, each of us
handling a separate area, Tam called in some favors with the head of the NYU
computer center and adapted an off-the-shelf program for stock transactions to
suit our unique requirements. She then booked time and scheduled a few debugging
runs. In the meantime Henderson was taking care of our banking preparations,
opening a string of accounts, mostly offshore where we could move with
comparative anonymity. Also, we all got together at his place a couple of times
and blocked out exactly what we wanted to unload first, names and dates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While Tam and Henderson were setting up the financial end,
the electronics were my responsibility. I was on the phone all day Tuesday
knocking heads with Artie Wilson, an old friend who operated a maritime radio
business down on the island of St. Thomas. Together we assembled a piece of
gear needed to address one of the essential telemetry elements, and Wednesday
night he took his boat over to St. Croix to install it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I think I've already mentioned the marvelous Caribbean beach
house that had practically fallen into my and Joanna's hands a few years back.
It also sported, as do a lot of island places, a TV satellite dish, and it so
happens this one was massive, a twenty-footer. Now, what is not commonly appreciated
is that those concave parabolas can be used to broadcast as well as receive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Artie and a couple of his cronies worked all Wednesday night
and got it rigged the way I wanted it, including a deadeye bead on the
commercial satellite currently being used by DNI for proprietary communications
with Noda's Kyoto office. I figured it like this: if &quot;Captain
Midnight&quot; could override Home Box Office's satellite network using a
receiving station in Florida and broadcast a Bronx cheer to Time-Life, we could
by God knock out DNI's high-security channel for an hour or so. Artie would be
on standby Friday, ready to flip the switch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda was apparently still in Japan, presumably busy throwing
obstacles in MITI's path, or maybe searching for the remains of his silver
case. Let him. We were about to start handling his communications with the DNI
office for him, via a setup of our own devising.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One nice thing about global electronics is that if you get a
network far-flung enough, nobody can trace anything—which was what we were
counting on. After we'd killed Noda's primary communications system, we
intended to substitute some Japanese hardware we'd had installed at
Henderson's—together with a little help from a mutual friend in Shearson
Lehman's Tokyo office. The arrangement was complicated, but it looked workable
on paper. Thing was, though, we'd have to get it right the first time. No dry
runs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All of which tended to make me uneasy. You don't leave
anything to chance when you're playing our kind of game; you need to have a
backup. This feeling brought to mind an admonition in an old sixteenth-century
text on swordsmanship, the Heiho Kaden Sho, something to the effect that
&quot;you should surprise your opponent once, and then surprise him
again.&quot; So, strictly on my own, I went about a bit of <i>bushido</i>
lawyering, using that power of attorney Noda gave me back when we started out
to set up a fallback position in case Tam's scheme somehow failed. This twist,
however, I decided to keep under wraps. Nobody needed to be diverted just then
worrying about worst-case scenarios. That's what corporate counsels are for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was the most hectic week of our lives, but by three P.M.
Friday we were ready, assembled at Henderson's place and poised for battle.
Using his new hardware, we got on line to Shearson's Tokyo office, Bill cashing
in a decade of stock tips with a longtime acquaintance. We then fed him the
MITI ID codes we'd picked up from Ken during that ill-fated episode at the
Tsukuba Teleconferencing Center, and he used these to patch back through to
their New York JETRO offices. Finally we got St. Croix on the phone, holding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Time to synchronize everybody's watches.&quot; Tam was
wearing her usual designer jeans, a blue silk shirt, and had her DNI flight bag
freshly packed for the long days ahead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That thing says 3:28:37.&quot; Henderson was watching
one of his monitors behind the bar, now blinking off the seconds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then let's all get ready to set at 3:29,&quot; said
Tam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which we did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, time to roll.&quot; I punched the speakerphone.
The line to St. Croix was still open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ready, Artie?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Say the word, my man,&quot; the voice from the box came
back. &quot;We got the watts.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You on frequency?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Loud and clear. Sound like they runnin' some kind of
coded transmission. Don't read.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Double-check, Artie. We can't mess up. You're on 26RF-
37558JX-10, right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yo, my man. Who doin' this?&quot; He bristled.
&quot;Think I can't hit nothing 'less it got hair round it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just nervous up here, okay? Settle down. At
three-thirty, exactly twenty-seven seconds from now, go to transmit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No problem.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stay on channel, Artie. Don't wipe out The Old Ttme
Gospel Hour or something. We're about to be in enough trouble as it</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You the one 'bout to be up to yo' ass in bad news,
frien'. Me, I just some oyster-shuckin' jive nigger don't know shit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. . . Except, I found myself thinking, how to make a monkey
out of the U.S. Coast Guard and DEA and God knows who else for ten years. Artie
was the best.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Disconcertingly, I might also add, Artie Wilson had demanded
cash in advance for our job, which didn't exactly reflect a high degree of
confidence in the endeavor. However, there was no way we could test what we
planned to do. This was it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've got fifteen seconds.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;One hand on the switch, boss, other on my—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Artie, stay focused—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thing is, jus' hope I remember which one to yank.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The big one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's what you think, white boy . . . zero. Blast off
. . . yooeee, they gone.&quot; Pause, then: &quot;Yep, we pumpin'.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Got it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just hit that little birdy with enough RF to light up
San Juan. They eatin' garbage. They decoder up in Apple town's gotta be goin'
apeshit. They can't be readin' no telex, no nothing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, keep it cranking.&quot; I turned to Tam.
&quot;You're on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're already patched through, on hold.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All the way through Tokyo and back?&quot; It was still
a bit dazzling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're going to look just like an auxiliary MITI
transmission. All I have to do is put in the DNI code, then request the
connection over to Third Avenue.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She tapped away on Henderson's keyboard, sending the ID
through Shearson's communications center in Tokyo, then back through JETRO on
Sixth Avenue, from whence it was routed into the communications room at DNI's
Third Avenue offices. Since she was using the standard DNI transmission format,
we would look authentic. Right now, with their primary satellite channel gone,
the JETRO link should be DNI's only high-security connection to the outside
world. She began the transmission, in Japanese <i>kana</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Attention: Eyes only; J. N. Tanaka. Special
instructions regarding operations. Please confirm routine satellite
communications channel currently inoperative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Moments later the message came back: Confirm communications
malfunction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Tam: Due to technical difficulties with transmitter,
weekend operations terminated. Staff advise alert number, message J9.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That last was DNI's special setup that caused the computer to
automatically dial the home number for all members of the staff, giving special
instructions. Message J9 told everybody not to come in until further
communication. God, was DNI efficient! The mainframe just kept dialing each
number till somebody picked up. It even talked to answering machines. We
figured that would head off most of the next crew. All we needed was a window
of a few minutes between the goings and comings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then a message came back. As Tam began translating for us,
though, a strange look was spreading across her face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Operations already suspended as of 2:57 NY time per
security-link instructions. Staff leave of absence. Is this confirmation?
Repeat. Is this confirmation?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What in hell.&quot; Henderson stared at Tam, then me.
&quot;Whose damned instructions?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, what do you think's going on?&quot; Tarn's
fingers were still poised above the keyboard. &quot;Why on earth would DNI
Kyoto order a shutdown here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's a big question.&quot; One that had no answer.
&quot;Better just fake it, and fast.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What else can we do?&quot; She revolved back around to
the keyboard and began to type.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Confirmation. What personnel remain?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Back came Tanaka's reply: As instructed, security personnel
only.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, get off the line. This feels wrong.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She wheeled back again. Transmission concluded. Standby for
further instruction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tanaka's reply was brief and to the point. A man of few
words: Confirmed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Whatever's going on, we've got to get over there.&quot;
I hit the speakerphone line again. &quot;Artie, keep them jammed till five oh
five. That should do it. If we're not in by then, we're dead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You got it, boss,&quot; came back the voice. &quot;Any
longer, some gov'ment honkie's gonna put on a trace. Be our ass. Correction,
yo' ass.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just pack up your gear and haul out of there. The FCC's
the least of our problems at the moment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You the man. Down again soon?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can't rule it out. Take care.&quot; I punched off the
phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam was already headed for the door. Downstairs waited the
car and driver we'd hired. No point trying to hail a cab in rush hour,
particularly with so much depending on the next thirty minutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, Bill, keep that Shearson link up. Maybe it'll
block anybody else from reaching DNI's message center.&quot; I was putting on
my coat. &quot;Where's that package?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right here.&quot; He reached behind the bar and
retrieved the one item I wanted with me when we confronted security. It was
nicely wrapped in brown paper. &quot;Look out for yourself, Walton. I got a few
good drinkin' years left. Be a shame to have to do it all by myself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your guy ready?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Says he's on his way. Due here inside fifteen
minutes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without further farewells we headed for the elevator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The trip over brought forth various thoughts on what lay
immediately ahead. For some reason I found myself remembering Yukio Mishima,
who once voiced a very perceptive observation on the nature of swordsmanship.
He claimed that the perfect stroke must be guided toward a void in space,
which, at that instant, your opponent's body will enter. In other words your
enemy takes on the shape of that hollow space you have envisioned, assuming a
form precisely identical with it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How does that happen? It occurs only when both the timing and
placement of a stroke are exactly perfect, when your choice of moment and the
fluidity of your movement catch your opponent unawares. Which means you must
have an intuitive sense of his impending action a fraction of a second before
it becomes known to your, or his, rational mind. The ability to strike
intuitively before your logical processes tell you your opponent's vulnerable
moment has arrived requires a mystical knowledge unavailable to the left side
of the brain, because by the time that perfect instant becomes known to your
conscious mind, it has already passed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The point is, if you allow yourself to think before you
strike, you blow it. Which is why one of the primary precepts of <i>bushido</i>
is &quot;To strike when it is right to strike.&quot; Not before, not after, not
when you rationally decide the moment has come, but when it is right. That
moment, however, is impossible to anticipate logically. It can only be sensed
intuitively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My intuition, as we rode the elevator up toward Dai Nippon's
center of operations, was troubled. The offices had been cleared in advance of
our arrival by somebody from DNI's Kyoto operation. We had struck at the proper
void in space, all right, but our opponent had deliberately created that
opening. Things weren't supposed to happen that way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the elevator light showed eleven and the door glided
open. We were there. Before us lay the steel doors of The Kingdom. While Tam
gave the computer a voice ID, I stood to the side readying the surprise I
planned for Noda's security twosome. Off came the brown paper, then the
scabbard, and in my hand gleamed a twelfth-century katana from the sword-smith
who once served the Shogun Yoritomo Minamoto. The prize of my collection. It
was, arguably, the most beautiful, sharpest, hardest piece of steel I had ever
seen. With the spirit of the shoguns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ready?&quot; She glanced over as the doors slid open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Awaiting us just inside the first doors were the X-ray and
metal detector, the latter a walk-through arch like you see in airports. Then
past that were the second doors, beyond which were stationed the two
Uzi-packing guards. The detector was set to automatically lock the second doors
if metal was detected on the persons of those passing through, and the wires
leading out of it were encased in an aluminum tube, attached there on the left.
This would have to be fast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The sword was already up, poised, and as we entered, it
flashed. Out went the electronic box with one clean stroke, the encased wires
severed at the exact point where they exited from the gray metal. There was no
alarm, not a sound. We'd iced it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Beautiful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I figured there would be time for exactly two more strokes,
but they had to be right, intuitively perfect. So at that moment I shut down my
rational mind, took a deep breath, and gave my life to Zen. Mental autopilot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The connecting doors slid open, and there stood the guards.
We'd caught them both flat-footed. So far, so good. Now the sword . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yukio Mishima, whom I mentioned earlier, once asserted that
opposites brought to their logical extremes eventually come to resemble one
another, that life is in fact a great circle. Therefore, whenever things appear
to diverge, they are actually on a path that brings them back together—an idea
of unity captured visually in the image of the snake swallowing its own tail.
According to him there is a realm wherein the spirit and the flesh, the sensual
and the rational, the yin and yang, all join. But to achieve this ultimate
convergence you must probe the edge, take your body and mind to the farthest
limits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'd been reflecting considerably on what this meant to us.
Noda's two heavies personified brute physicality, the body triumphant; Tam and
I were meeting them with the power of the mind and, I hoped, finely honed
intuition. Whereas these may seem the farthest of opposites, as with the symbol
of the snake, they merged at their extremities. They became one. I knew it and
the two startled guys now staring at us understood it as well. Mind and body
were about to intersect. The circle had joined.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Their Uzis—about two feet long, black, heavy clip, metal
stock—were hanging loosely from shoulder straps several inches away from their
hands. I saw them both reach for the grip, but that sight didn't really
register. My cognitive processes were already shut down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>While the first man's left-hemisphere neurons were
telling his right hand to reach downward, the sword was already moving,
milliseconds ahead. It caught the gun's heavy leather strap, parting it like
paper, and the Uzi dropped, just eluding his fingers. He stood naked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was all for him and he immediately knew it. If you're
looking at a razor-sharp <i>katana</i>, you don't get a fallback try. However,
the second guard, dark eyebrows and bald head, now had time on his side. Up
came the automatic, one-handed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Right here let me say you've got to admire his pluck. If I'd
been staring at a four-foot katana that could have bisected me like a noodle, I
might have elected to pass. But he'd weighed the odds and concluded he had a
chance. Again, though, his rationality bought us time. The neurons firing in
his brain were setting in motion a sequence of logic. He was thinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The sword wasn't. My blank mind was centered on the void, the
place where the Uzi would be when it was leveled at my chest. The overhead
stroke caught it just where intuition said it would be, point-blank, his finger
a millimeter from the trigger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Cheap Israeli steel. The eight-hundred-year-old katana of
Yoritomo Minamoto's swordsmith parted the Uzi's perforated black barrel like
Hotel Bar butter, bifurcated it into identical slices. Guard number two just
grunted as it clattered to the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By my reckoning we'd been in the inner chamber for about
three quarters of a second, but Noda's two human mountains were now standing
there holding nothing but time in their hands. Nobody had to draw them a
picture. The game was over. <i>Bushido</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I motioned Tam toward the first guard's weapon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matthew . . .&quot; She hesitated a moment, then
snapped into action. &quot;You weren't kidding about that sword. I never
realized—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right.&quot; She now had the one remaining automatic.
The other was no longer usable. Didn't matter. One was all we needed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We now had to kill the automatic ID on the outer door and put
it on manual. Otherwise the two guards upstairs might come calling. While Tam
stood there with the Uzi, I went back out and yanked the wires that hooked the
voice reader to the computer. There was probably a scientific way to turn it
off, but who had time for science? Besides, just then my veins were still
pumping pure adrenaline. Facing the business end of an Uzi, even for a fleeting
instant, is no way to begin an evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam ordered the guards to open the last door and in we
marched. Tanaka was standing outside his office, his dark eyes glazed, his
bristle-covered skull rosy with shock. He turned even redder when he saw the <i>katana</i>.
Nobody had to tell him what it could do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton, why are you here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're about to undertake some corporate
restructuring.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam proceeded to herd Tanaka and the guards into Noda's
office, pausing just long enough to kill the phone wires. As he began to
recover, he commenced sputtering about legal action and jail and general
hellfire. Who cared? As of this moment, the offices and computer of Dai Nippon,
International belonged to us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Henderson was informed of our progress when his phone rang at
exactly 4:48 P.M. He arrived, along with his Georgia Mafia computer expert, at
5:17, and Tam met them at the security doors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I wasn't actually there to welcome them aboard, since I was
guarding Tanaka just then and engaged in a small one-on-one with the man,
explaining to him that Matsuo Noda's ass was ours. The president of Dai Nippon,
I advised, was a few short days away from becoming everybody's lead story,
featured as the Japanese executive who'd (apparently) rebelled against his
homeland. Noda was no stranger to headlines, of course, but he preferred to
engineer them himself, so this definitely wasn't going to be his style. Matsuo
Noda was, albeit unwillingly, about to make history. As I broke this news to
Dai Nippon's chief of New York operations, I sensed he was definitely less than
enthusiastic about the prospect. Well, he'd have a few days to get used to the
idea, since nobody was going to enter or leave the eleventh floor for a while.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was still a bit difficult to believe what had happened. Or
even more, what was next. But sometimes reality can have a way of outstripping
your wildest powers of imagination—a Space Shuttle explodes, a nuclear meltdown
in the Ukraine, ten-dollar oil, all of it too farfetched to make credible
fiction. It could only exist in the realm of the real.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We were about to start moving billions and billions of
dollars, fast. And since we didn't know how long we could continue before
Matsuo Noda figured out a way to stop us, we were going to adhere to a schedule
that covered the most vital sectors first—those outfits whose R&amp;D Tam
considered strategic to America's future technological leadership. Our goal for
the first day was five billion, worldwide.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thus the countdown began. Henderson's financial artist loaded
Tam's new program tape onto DNI's big NEC supercomputer and cranked up. We had
roughly sixty hours till the opening bell on Monday.</span></p>

<h4><a name=bookmark13><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</span></a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:1.0pt;color:windowtext'><img
width=33 height=33 src="images/image025.jpg" alt=""></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's the worst of times, buddy, and the best of times.
Whatever dude once said that didn't know the half of it. He oughta be around
now to check out the Street.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was Henderson's Georgia Mafia co-conspirator, an
irritatingly smug young man with red hair and acne who dressed entirely in
white, right down to his skinny Italian tie. We were told he went by the handle
of Jim Bob. As he meditated upon Wall Street's macroeconomic incongruities, he
punched a Willie Nelson tape into his boom box and popped a Coors, pregame
warm-up for programming a full-scale assault on the U.S. securities markets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jim Bob allowed as how he'd arrived in the Big Apple four
years earlier with a cardboard suitcase, a finance degree from Georgia Tech,
and a larger than regulation endowment of natural cunning. After a couple of
years' toil in Henderson's quasi-legal vineyards, he'd gone out on his own,
whereupon he'd parlayed his winnings with Bill and the remnants of a baseball
scholarship into what was now a high six-figure &quot;haircut,&quot; the name
options players use for their grubstake. The way he figured it, he was just
hitting his stride.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How, I inquired at one point during that long weekend, had he
managed it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Chum, it's idiot simple. You buy into fear, sell into
greed, and fuck fundamentals. Main thing is, if something makes sense, don't do
it. America's in the all-time shit, and Wall Street's oblivious. It's like
everybody's bidding up standing room on the Tttanic. But who cares? You play
options like I do and all you have to worry about is not getting stupider than
the herd. Which ain't necessarily much of a trick.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stock options, he went on to assert, were like having a
credit card in a whorehouse—a ton of action for what amounted to tip money up
front. No wonder Las Vegas was in trouble, when Wall Street was beckoning our
high rollers to take odds on the direction of the market. Only widows and
orphans, he observed, bought actual securities anymore. That action was
reserved for the halt and lame.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While country singers twanged beer hall soliloquies on the
general increase in faithless women, Jim Bob coded in the brokerage houses and
offshore banks we'd be using, the catalog of stocks in the DNI portfolio, and
our sequence of transactions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As noted earlier, the financial setup had been handled by
Henderson and friends. Using his connections, he'd opened accounts for hundreds
of dummy corporations in about two dozen offshore banks. He stuck to the usual
no-questions-asked operations like Banca della Svizzera Italiana and Bank Leu
in the Bahamas—the latter a Swiss-owned Nassau laundry that had, in years past,
reportedly destroyed records and lied to the Securities and Exchange Commission
as a favor to certain of America's more inventive inside traders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since the volume of money to be moved was staggering, it
would all be handled by sophisticated telecommunications networks. We would
pass it through the anonymous accounts we'd established, accessed both ways by
computer, and it would never be touched by human hands. DNI's cash would flash
in and out with total cover. Added to that, anybody who tried to trace us would
first have to break through a traditional Swiss stone wall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>To dump the stock we were planning to exploit fully the new
&quot;globalization&quot; of the financial scene. Now that the National
Association of Securities Dealers had struck a deal with the London and Tokyo
stock exchanges to swap price quotes, worldwide market makers were buying and
selling American securities around the clock. Plenty of active market-making
was happening off the exchange floors as well, at places like Jeffries out on
the coast, which had recently handled a massive Canadian takeover of an
American company overnight, entirely off-exchange. With all the avenues
available it was almost impossible to track the movement in a given issue.
DNI's computers would be routing sell orders to brokerage firms around the
globe, a block here, a block there, none of them in quantities that would raise
eyebrows.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe I also should add that none of the
&quot;corporations&quot; Henderson had set up would be allowed to show a
profit, which would simplify Treasury Department reporting requirements. As a
matter of fact, before we were through, DNI was going to lose billions. But it
would all be done legally, in accordance with SEC regs. It would also lead to a
world financial flap of notable proportions. Nobody would ever take Noda's
money for granted again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While Tam went over her new program with Jim Bob, pointing
out her special features, Henderson and I found ourselves at reasonably loose
ends. We sat around drinking green tea (God, how I came to hate that stuff) and
puzzling how we'd all managed to get into such a mess. The major plus, however,
was that we finally had Matsuo Noda by the short and curlies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or so we hoped. The problem was, he'd been a player longer
than any of us, and he'd already demonstrated plenty of stamina. How would he
counterattack? The question wasn't if, it was when. For the moment, though, we
seemed to be on our way with clear sailing; in fact, the communications link
with Kyoto was entirely empty. Tanaka also had clammed up, refusing to
talk—beyond a rather firm prediction that our wholesale divestiture of DNI's
assets was an insane act doomed to failure. I might also add he didn't appear
nearly as concerned as the circumstances would seem to merit. In fact, he was
so complacent I started getting a little uneasy. Finally Bill and I ran his
prediction past young Jim Bob. Could somebody get through to Tam's program and
devise a way to shut us down?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Henderson's increasingly glassy-eyed protege took out enough
time from popping &quot;uppers&quot; and swilling Coors to assure us to the
contrary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hell, no way you could stop what we're settin' up here.
We got ourselves what you call a closed system. Everything's</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>going to be
handled by that green-eyed monster over there in the corner. We got these
numbered brokerage accounts all over the place. Zip, in go the sell orders;
zap, out go confirmations. And since none of the cash sits around, our bank
accounts are all just gonna churn. We'll have billions of buckaroos rollin' at
the speed of light. Ain't nobody gonna be able to get a bead on the action,
take my word for it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Our computer-generated buying and selling, he went on to
declare, was conveniently similar in appearance to the &quot;program&quot;
trading of the big institutional investors, the arbitrage players who routinely
sold millions of dollars of securities in minutes using computers. Thanks to
them, the market these days had been conditioned to accept huge, unaccountable
trades as part of the territory. If somebody dumped massive blocks of stock
unexpectedly, it could mean anything—such as, the spread between those stocks'
prices and some &quot;index future&quot; had gotten momentarily out of sync.
Shuffling securities like poker chips was the name of the game on the Street
these days, so nobody would really notice or care. The turnover we'd be generating
would merely suggest to the market that various investment-house arbitrage
desks were unwinding positions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What the heck, I said to Tam, maybe we could unload the
better part of DNI's holdings before Noda struck back. The real key to our
attack on Dai Nippon, however, depended on what happened to that cash after we
turned it around. When I mentioned that, she just crossed her fingers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By late Sunday night the DNI offices were a clutter of empty
Chinese take-out containers, Kentucky Fried Chicken boxes, and computer
printouts. However, Jim Bob claimed the system looked like a go. He'd completed
a long sequence of test runs, and he was predicting he could probably swing at
least four billion the first day, something in the nature of a warm-up for
grander things to come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jim Bob, I should say, was fully as efficient as advertised
by Henderson. Even if he was now flying higher than a moon shot, thanks to all
the pills. He worked methodically, carefully analyzing the program at every
step, double-checking the codes, poring over his verification printouts for
obscure glitches. Mainly, though, he kept one unfocused eye on the clock,
saying he always delivered on time. Point of honor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thus it was that, when Monday morning rolled around, we</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>were primed
to move on Wall Street. Tam's program was poised inside the mainframe like some
lurking id, ready to be unleashed. We decided to start modestly, sticking to
the exchanges in New York, and only later in the day expanding outward as we
gained firmer footing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At the stroke of nine-thirty A.M. Jim Bob inaugurated our
maiden run with yet another beer. Henderson and I poured ourselves a bourbon.
Tam even joined us, accepting a respectable shot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fasten your seat belts, boys and girls.&quot; Jim Bob
shakily peeled back the tab on his Coors. The screen in front of him focused
our attention down to one small flashing green dot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ignition.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He hit a key on the terminal, and Merrill Lynch got a
computerized &quot;sell&quot; order for ten thousand shares of Texas
Instruments. The time was exactly 9:31.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was a textbook lift-off. Rows of green numbers began to
scroll up the screen, only to blink and disappear. By God, the thing seemed to
be working. We had just pulled the plug on DNI. All that was left now was to
sit back and watch it sink.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the morning wore on, Tam fielded phone calls from
staffers, always claiming that Tanaka was not available just then. Of course,
we weren't sure how long we could get away with that excuse, but for now none
of us wanted to set the man free to start jabbering in Japanese on the phone.
On the other hand, we were loosening up a bit on security. Partly, I guess,
because we were all increasingly wrecked, but also because it seemed to fit the
situation. By Monday, Tanaka and his two retired sumo bone-crushers appeared to
have grown resigned, one might even say philosophical, and I don't mind
admitting it bothered me a lot. Tanaka was watching us destroy Noda's grand
design right before his very eyes, yet he just sat there as though none of it
mattered. How could this be? All he did was busy around brewing tea for
everybody. (Except, of course, for Jim Bob, who stuck to Coors.) However, I was
too tired by then to think much about it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Around two-thirty Henderson began complaining of a splitting
headache and declared he had to go home and get some rest. I started to
protest, but the man looked half dead. Tam and I weren't much better off, so we
flipped a coin to see who would take the first watch. She won, which was great
by me, since the long hours without sleep were really starting to unravel my
concentration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>To understand what happened next, you have to try and
envision the scene. It was three P.M. and things were going letter perfectly.
The dollars were sailing through the accounts we'd set up and along about noon
we'd even kicked in our buy program.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, buy. That's not a typo. You see, we had to lose
billions, not necessarily a trivial task. Think about it. If you merely want to
drop a few million, all you have to do is just invest in some high-flying
start-up and then sit there till the venture craters. But billions?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's the part where Tam really showed her mettle (no pun
intended). Look, she said, the Brothers Hunt managed to blow millions by trying
to corner silver, bidding up the price and then seeing it collapse. But we've
got to get rid of some serious money, so why don't we do the same thing, only
with a commodity worth something?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Platinum.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All life's great ideas have an inevitable simplicity. That's
right, we were programmed to sell DNI's stock and buy platinum. From anybody,
anywhere, at any price. We were planning to just swallow the worldwide
commodity markets in the stuff, starting at the NY Merc and ending at Capetown.
Of course, what we were also doing was boosting its price into the
stratosphere—we were even bidding against ourselves through different brokerage
houses. Anything to drive it up. I mean we had a lot of money to get rid of. We
figured that by the time we were finished, DNI would be the proud owner of a
couple of hundred billion in platinum metal, platinum futures, platinum mining
stocks, platinum storage companies, platinum dealerships, platinum reserves,
platinum investment coins. All of it at a price as high as we could push. I was
betting on two thousand dollars an ounce by Friday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The nice part was, what central bank was going to step in?
Platinum was strategic, sure, but it wasn't a monetary metal. And if we had to
bid against governments, so much the better. We were playing a drunken
speculator's dream, going all out for the most volatile of all the world's
commodities. After we'd squeezed that scam for every ounce it was worth, we
would deliberately puncture the bubble and let the price nosedive. We were
going to destroy the cancer of Dai Nippon by gorging Noda's takeover machine
with financial poison. The eventual collapse should wipe out Matsuo Noda
totally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Platinum. I asked Jim Bob to check the waning moments of
Monday's spot market, the latest prices down at the NY Merc, and he reported it
had scooted up about twenty dollars an ounce. A little slow maybe, but then we
were just starting out. I figured it would probably double in a couple of days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Such was my fond hope as I drifted off for a nap on my desk.
Tam was in Tanaka's office, half-nodding in her chair, while Jim Bob was
sitting before his monitor, still nourishing himself with beer and colored
pills. I gave him the Uzi and told him to help Tam out by keeping an eye on
Tanaka and the two guards, all now sleeping like a baby. My last vision was of
Jim Bob sitting there, the Uzi draped over his wrinkled white lap, clicking
away at the keyboard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I slept right through Emma's four-o'clock phone call from my
office downtown. When I awoke around nine P.M. Jim Bob mentioned she'd rung. No
message, he said. Then don't worry about it, I mumbled to myself; get back to
her in the morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam didn't seem to remember the call, which momentarily
troubled me. Had we both been dozing at the helm? Well, who could blame her? In
spite of my own nap I still felt like hell, so I dragged myself up, stretched,
wandered around the office, drank some more green tea, and inquired of Jim Bob
how things seemed to be proceeding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Looking good.&quot; He grinned. He was now working Hong
Kong and the Asian exchanges, limbering up the satellites as he flashed our
(DNI's) money around the globe. Anybody heard from Henderson? Not a word, he
said in a tone that seemed disconcertingly pat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I briefly toyed with heading down to the street and trying to
locate an early &quot;bulldog&quot; Times to see what kind of a splash we were
making in the press, but since Tam was now sound asleep, I figured I'd better
stick to duty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I vaguely recall stumbling into my office to rummage for an
old box of NoDoz stashed somewhere there in the desk, and thinking how nice it
would be just to lean back in the chair. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A phone was jangling in my ear. As I pulled erect, the clock
on my desk was reading ten-thirty—My God, A.M.—and I felt as if I'd been run
over by an eighteen-wheeler. What the hell was in that green tea Tanaka had
been brewing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Inside the receiver at my ear was Emma, and what she had to
say brought me awake like an ice-cold shower. In a voice</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>brimming
with triumph, she announced she'd just resigned and I could consider this
official notice thereof. In fact, she was price-shopping Florida condos this
very minute—what did I think of Coral Gables?—and I was lucky she'd bothered to
take out time to inform me of her intended plans. By Wednesday she expected to
be able to loan money to the Rockefellers, in case they should need a little
liquidity on short notice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How'd you come by this sudden fortune? I asked. Where, she
snapped back, have you been? The Dow Jones average was about to double, if it
hadn't already. Funny, but the rest of the market was going nowhere. Oddest
thing she'd ever seen. However, it only went to show what she'd always told me,
and if I'd listened to her instead of those smarty-pants uptown brokers, I'd be
rich now too. Stick with the blue chips. IBM was up thirty percent since
yesterday, AT&amp;T was flying, GM was selling for a price that would make you
think they were back in the car business.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What the hell was she talking about! That's when I noticed a
copy of Tuesday's New York Times lying there on my desk, right next to the
phone. Only at first it didn't seem like the Times. Or maybe Punch Sulzberger
had just been swallowed whole by Rupert Murdoch, because I hadn't seen a
headline that arresting since the Posts immortal &quot;Coed Jogger Slain in
Bed.&quot; It was banner, right across the top; the Times' headline writer was
practically orgasmic. But whereas the Post gets off on mere sex, the good gray
Times reserves its libidinous juices for that ageless aphrodisiac, money.</span></p>

Stock Exchange yesterday, as buyers for Big Board issues responded worldwide to

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>I came off my chair like a shot and headed for Tam's
office. &quot;Is anybody following what's going on outside?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her face was down on the desk, dark hair tousled across her
cheeks. She looked up and rubbed her eyes, obviously knocked out too. Strange.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What . . . ?&quot; Her voice was slurred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Something's gone crazy,&quot; I yelled. &quot;Where's
Henderson?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I remembered he wasn't there. However, I did locate Jim
Bob easily enough. He was in Noda's corner office, wideawake and still carrying
our Uzi. Only now there were two of those long black automatics present, the
other lying atop the wide teakwood desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One more thing. Seated behind that desk, his silver hair
framed by the sunlight streaming through the wide back windows, was . . .
Matsuo Noda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Shogun had arrived.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And with him came the dawn of a new, powerful reality. My
drugged mind was flooded with the ramifications. Matsuo Noda, I now realized,
had been on to us from the start. Once again he had used us. He had been the
one who had emptied the office, the better to lure us in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But the guards . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda-san, I bow to a true samurai. A swordsman's swordsman.
Of course, it was as simple as it was elegant. You were testing us, allowing us
a plausible opening, just difficult enough to force us to reveal our true
strategy. The dictum of the masters: &quot;If you want to strike your enemy,
let him try to strike you first. The moment he strikes you, you have already
succeeded in striking him.&quot; Pure <i>bushido</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Everything up till now had only been feints. What I
assumed was the battle turned out to have merely been staking out terrain,
jockeying for position. At last, though, we were ready for the real engagement.
Trouble was, Matsuo Noda had just secured the high ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on in and have yourself a seat, Walton.&quot; Jim
Bob beckoned toward the vacant chair as he sipped from a glass of California
champagne, its plastic-looking bottle stationed on the floor beside him. Coors
time was over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jim Bob, what's happening with the market?&quot; I was
ignoring Noda for the moment, trying to get a firmer grasp on the new
&quot;prevailing conditions.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;'Bout what we figured,&quot; he replied, his white suit
now greasy and wrinkled. &quot;Yep, looks like we're roughly on schedule.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's a relief to know there's a timetable.&quot; I
finally turned to Noda. &quot;Wouldn't want this takeover to be
half-cocked.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton, if you would be so kind.&quot; He smiled
and indicated the chair. &quot;It would be well for you to join us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jim Bob waved me over with his Uzi. &quot;Fact is, we're all
about due for a little show and tell.&quot; He glanced up as Tarn entered the
doorway. &quot;Be a good idea if you got up to speed on what we're doing here,
too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I just scrolled some prices,&quot; she said, glaring
groggily at Noda, the morbid realization descending rapidly now. &quot;You
don't have to tell me anything. I know exactly what you're doing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What we're doing is, we're pulling this country out of
the shit. That's what we're doing. We're saving this country's ass. Which is
more than anybody else here's doing,&quot; Jim Bob continued, satisfaction in
his voice. &quot;How in hell did you ever think you could pull something like
you were trying? Mr. Noda here could squash you all just like a june bug
anytime he gets a mind, take my word for it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda still hadn't amplified the new Dai Nippon scenario, but
he didn't really need to bother.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jim Bob, don't spoil the fun and tell me. Let me try to
guess.&quot; I glanced over at Noda, then back at him. &quot;He suckered you in
with his 'Rescue America' spiel. World peace at a price.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, tell you the truth, the man did buy me
lunch.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll bet that's not all he did, you opportunistic son
of a bitch.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I examined Noda. &quot;How does it feel to have Japan about
to be sole owner of IBM and AT&amp;T and GM and . . . guess I could just check
the supercomputer out there for the full list.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Certain strategic corporations.&quot; Noda smiled
benignly. &quot;It had become the only meaningful direction to proceed, Mr.
Walton. I'm afraid our other measures were clearly too little, too late.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why bother with the small fish, right? If you're going
to buy up American technology, do it right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton, we both know it is inevitable. Neither you
nor I can alter the tides of history.&quot; He sighed. &quot;Perhaps Japan can
provide the management guidance required to save America's industrial base, but
it cannot be achieved merely by dabbling. Stronger measures, much stronger,
were required. I finally came to see that. The problem was how to do it without
a major psychological disruption of the market and more Japan bashing. Then by
the greatest of good fortune, you solved my problem for me.&quot; He nodded
toward Tam. &quot;Your new trading program, Dr. Richardson, which allowed us to
operate anonymously, was ideal. Why not make use of it? Particularly since Mr.
Henderson had the personnel to render it operational.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While digesting that, I returned my attention to Jim Bob.
&quot;Let me guess some more. Ten to one you bought 'call' options on the Big
Board issues he was planning to take over.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, they were bound to go up.&quot; He flashed a reptilian
grin as he adjusted the Uzi, now a bolt of black against his rumpled white
suit. &quot;If you're standing by the road and a gravy bus comes along, what
are you going to do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Terrific. Be a pity for this insider windfall to go to
waste. Just wanted to make double sure you got a piece for yourself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Does a bear crap in the woods?&quot; he inquired
rhetorically, then tipped back his head and drained the champagne glass.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right. So naturally you bought call options on the Blue
Chips, locking in a cheap price just before Noda's money boosted them into the
clouds.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Safe and simple. Of course, some traders go for index
options, S&amp;P 500*s and indicators like that, but that's always been too
airy-fairy for me. When the market's set to head up, I just buy calls. Heavy leverage.
No risk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I concurred. &quot;Nothing too abstruse.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The thing of it is, I'm more comfortable dealing with
reality,&quot; he went on. &quot;I like to kick the tires, check under the
hood, so that index crap's not my style. Like I always say, if you've got hold of
something you can't figure out how to drink, drive, or screw, maybe you oughta
ask yourself what you're doing with it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A pragmatic criterion, I agreed. 'Though it's rather a pity
you didn't cut me in on the play. I could have used the money.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Walton,&quot; he replied, &quot;it downright pains me
to have to be the one breakin' the news to you, but you could have used the
money more than you think. Whose bank balances do you figure I've been using to
test out that platinum program?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In the spirit of intellectual curiosity, Jim Bob, does
our new system for blowing capital show promise?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;From the looks of my early churning, I'd say you got
yourself a winner.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The fucker. How in hell did he get access to my money? I
decided to just ask, whereupon he obligingly explained.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, we're hooked into every bank computer in
town.&quot; He was unblinking, a drugged-out zombie. &quot;Account numbers
aren't exactly a state secret, given the right phone call. Same goes for trust
funds.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Trust funds?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me be sure I've got this straight. You've also
wiped out my daughter Amy's college money? She's now penniless too?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're close, real close.&quot; He reached down and
retrieved the bottle, then sloshed more of the cheap bubbly into his glass.
&quot;I'm figuring I can have everything down to a goose egg by sometime round
about . . . lunch, probably.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I decided then and there I was going to kill him, and Matsuo
Noda, with my own bare hands. The only question was whether to do it at that
moment or later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jim Bob, for the record, you two've just fucked with
the wrong guy. When somebody starts messing with Amy's future, I tend to lose
my sense of proportion.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing personal, Walton. You just had to be stopped,
that's all.&quot; He grinned. &quot;Figured it'd get your attention. Besides,
way I see it, this man here's absolutely right. He's got the only answer that
makes any sense.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As long as sellout artists like you get rich in the
process.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's in the grand American tradition, buddy.
Enlightened self-interest, better known as looking out for number one. Everybody
else here's hocking this country's assets to Japan and gettin' rich doing it.
So why not? Besides, we've still got a ways to go. Time to give you-all a piece
of this thing too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If we play ball?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Exactly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You greedy prick.&quot; I was considering just
strangling him on the spot, nice and uncomplicated. &quot;Noda's not here for
anybody but himself. He's—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's not the way I see it.&quot; He glanced over
toward The Man, who was still silent as a sphinx.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You wouldn't have the brains to understand even if we told
you. But maybe there's something you can comprehend.&quot; I glanced at the
metal grip of the Uzi on Noda's desk. One lightning move and it was in my hand.
&quot;I'm not going to let you do this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's already done, pal.&quot; He lifted his own Uzi and
leveled it at my forehead, grinning, his little idea of a joke. &quot;I've got
that NEC mainframe out there programmed for weeks of trading. Billions . . .
Pow!&quot; He jerked the barrel upward, then continued, &quot;Way I've got it
rigged, ain't nobody can turn it off now. We'd just as well all go
fishing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jim Bob, take care with that gun. Somebody might just
decide to ram it down your scrawny throat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ain't gonna be you, buddy.&quot; He reached for the
champagne bottle again, no longer grinning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton.&quot; Finally Noda spoke again. &quot;I
assure you this is for the best. What you two were planning was very
ill-considered. Not to mention that, if I'd actually permitted you to sink Dai
Nippon's capital into some volatile commodity and then manipulate the markets,
you might have given our institutional investors an enormous loss of confidence
in my program. I have a responsibility to make sure that never happens.&quot;
He studied Tam. &quot;Dr. Richardson, you especially disappointed me. You
betrayed my trust, something I always find unforgivable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You betrayed my trust.&quot; She looked ready to
explode. &quot;Lied to me, exploited me, used me. You perverted everything I
had planned—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As I've explained, this had become necessary. There was
no other way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How about Ken, and probably Allan Stern?&quot; she
interrupted. &quot;Was taking their lives 'necessary' too?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You have no proof of that,&quot; he continued smoothly.
&quot;I would further suggest that too much speculation is not a healthy
pursuit, Dr. Richardson. In the marketplace or in life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>           <i>If
the swordsman casts aside two thoughts, life and death, nothing can defeat his
mind.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was the credo of the formidable warrior-samurai Bokuden,
who lived during the early seventeenth century. Focus on Noda, I told myself,
not on staying alive. What we had to do was overcome him and the money of Japan
by the power of mind. By beating him at his own game. That was the only way we
could win.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I saw it, we might actually have the advantage. We knew
his strategy, so all we had to do now was move inside his defense perimeter. In
a way we were even closer than he realized. Noda was obsessed with Nipponica,
and a samurai concentrating on his sword is not able to attack. The thing to
remember was rhythm, the beat. We had to get out of sync with him, disrupt his
pacing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When Tam and I retreated to my office, I noticed that my <i>katana
</i>was missing. No surprise, but it didn't really matter. We would be using
the &quot;no sword&quot; technique anyway, moving under his hilt, then going in
for the kill. Jim Bob would be our new weapon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At the moment Noda's new hatchet man was strolling around the
floor in his dingy white suit, toting his Uzi and monitoring us with an
occasional vacant stare as he watched the terminal's flash. His bumpkin facade,
incidentally, had to be the best acting job I'd seen since the Royal
Shakespeare. He may have been a spaced-out options hustler at heart, but he
could coach Machiavelli on duplicity. A worthy opponent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just hit nine percent of IBM.&quot; He glanced at a CRT
screen as he ambled down the row next to my office, swinging the automatic.
&quot;Telephone looks good for twelve percent by</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>opening bell
tomorrow. Good thing we've got a computer and these fake accounts. Otherwise we
might have to cut the SEC in on the news a little too early.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, DNI was nothing if not organized; &quot;global
trading&quot; was on a roll. There would be no way to trace Noda—or to stop
him. By the time anybody realized what was afoot, he'd be well on the way to
having us literally bought out. God knows, Japan had the money.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jim Bob,&quot; I yelled across. &quot;Mind telling me
what the hell it is you really think you're up to?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm making history.&quot; He grinned and waved his Uzi
in the air. &quot;You're getting to watch the dawn of a new age.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;For your wallet.&quot; I beckoned him over. &quot;Tell
me something. You didn't actually sell any of the high-tech stocks on Tam's
list after all, did you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hell, no.&quot; He was still grinning. &quot;All we did
was play games a little. Whenever I sold anything, I just turned around and
bought it back a few minutes later.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So where's all the money coming from for this big blue
chip takeover?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We got a whole new financial network in place. Mr. Noda
worked it out with the pension funds over there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, it seems to me you ought to be doing this thing
right. Why think small? Pick up some more shares of those high-tech issues in
the old portfolio too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stared at me with his bloodshot eyes. &quot;How come we'd
want to bother with that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just thought maybe you'd like to make a score.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Besides, down the line it'd probably impress hell out
of Noda. The man admires initiative.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What was it you said about a score?&quot; He was
blinking in erratic bursts, still flying on uppers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Forget it. Just a crazy idea that crossed my
mind.&quot; I turned and walked back into the office . . . where Tam was
waiting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What was that all about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, did you hear what those bastards did?&quot; I was
steaming. 'They blew my daughter's college money.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I heard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, it pisses me off like I can't begin to
describe.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I gathered that.&quot; She looked at me strangely.
&quot;He finally</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>got to you,
didn't he? Noda finally pulled your cork. No more Mr. Cool.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You got it, lady.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She continued to study me, and into her eyes crept a kind of
affection I didn't even know they possessed. &quot;Guess that makes two of us,
Matt. He found out how to get to me, and now he's found out the one thing you
care about.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Guess he did at that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, now you know how I feel.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He broke the rules, Tam. That's not part of the game.
But do you understand what this means? Now I'm free to do anything I want.
Honor is out the window.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This isn't a game.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're right. It's a battle. But even battles have
rules.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My God, macho to the end.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Call it what you want. But I am now going to destroy
them both, totally. Wipe them out. They've given me no choice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How exactly do you propose doing that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I made the opening move just now. Next I'm . . .
later.&quot; I glanced up to see Jim Bob approaching. He was staring at me,
glassy-eyed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What was that you were saying a while ago?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't remember, Jim Bob.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Something about a score.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, that. Nothing really.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't start getting cute, Walton.&quot; He sighted his
Uzi around the office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nobody screws with you, right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Better believe it, sport.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I was just wondering, since Noda's tied up at the
moment, if you might want to go ahead and make a little money on the
side.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not doing so bad.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fine. Since you're not interested anyway, we can just
skip it. No big deal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hang on a second.&quot; His eyes seemed to be trying to
focus as he stared through his gunsights. &quot;What's the play?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Merely a wild idea, that's all. I was wondering what
would happen if you bought a few call options on those stocks already in the
portfolio, then boosted the prices on those too?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean on those high-tech outfits we were supposed to
start selling?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, the setup's just sitting out there. You've got
all that</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japanese
pension money and Noda's computer. No reason not to kite those high-tech issues
a little and pick up some pocket change. Fun and games to while away the time.
But then maybe you've already made all you want to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, asshole, there's two things you can't ever get too
much of, and one of them's money.&quot; He was rocking mechanically.
&quot;Matter of fact, this action we're generating is driving up the March
calls for our new buys to the point where the price is getting way out of
line.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Had to happen. Everybody else in town has figured out
somebody's driving the market. They're getting on the options bandwagon too,
bidding them up. So why not play a little market shell-game with those issues
already in the portfolio, buy some calls and then kite the price on them as
well? Show Noda a thing or two.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kind of stick it to the boss man.&quot; He paused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Think of it as insurance. Just to make sure you come
out of this play whole. Tell you a secret about Noda. With that guy, you know
you've got a deal when the check clears.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's a crafty fucker, grant you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You might want to give it some thought. But if you're
going to make a move, it's probably now or never. Be the early bird or forget
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All this time Tam was looking at me as if I'd gone over the
edge. I began to deeply regret not having filled her in on the fallback
scenario.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The door to Noda's office was now closed, his two guards
posted outside. Guess even a samurai needs some rest and tranquility after
flying halfway around the globe in a chartered Concorde.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, gotta admit it's an idea.&quot; Jim Bob continued
to weave unsteadily. His motor mechanisms were now on automatic, along with his
venal corn-pone brain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, what in hell are you doing?&quot; Tam was pulling
me back into the office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stay cool. Swordsmanship is like Zen. You can't ever
let your mind get attached to anything. Do that and you're stuck; your mind
stays with the past and makes you neglect what lies ahead. So I figure the best
thing to do here is to adjust to the new 'prevailing conditions.'&quot; I
glanced out at Jim Bob, now just beyond the door and absently humming some
Waylon Jennings tune as he swayed solo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I want to know what you're up to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, here's the play. While you were setting up your
sell-off scheme, I did some fiddling on my own. Remember back when we started
out, I fast-talked Noda into giving me power of attorney? Well, it finally paid
off. Last week I convened an instant shareholders' meeting for every company
where DNI owns a majority of the stock and personally voted through a new set
of resolutions.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mind filling me in on what they were?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before I could reply, Jim Bob came dancing in, licking his
pale lips. &quot;Walton, tell you what. Think I'm gonna go for it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot; I looked up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That options play. Comes a time you gotta look out for
yourself and fuck everybody.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the kind of thinking made this country what it
is today, Jim Bob. Right on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fuckin' A, baby.&quot; He did a quick dance step.
&quot;Go for the gold.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, as long as we're at it, how about a little
piece of the action for me too? Nothing big. Just a couple of bucks for old
times' sake.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why the hell not!&quot; He let out a whoop as he turned
and headed for a terminal. &quot;Give you sloppy seconds on this one, ace. Just
long as I get first pop.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, I don't know what you're up to, but I'll kill you
if you start helping him.&quot; She looked like she would too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, you once said you wanted to drive a stake
into DNI's heart.&quot; I turned back. &quot;Well, this is your chance. But
we've got to get moving and do it before Noda catches on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whereupon we joined Jim Bob in front of his monitor. He was
now busy pulling up quotes for March calls on the Chicago Board Options
Exchange, the CBOE. He checked them over, then got on the phone directly to the
market makers on the floor. When you're operating in hyperdrive, you don't
dawdle around with brokers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jim Bob, while you're doing that, I think I'll just
start setting up the buy orders for the stock. If we want to move prices, we've
got to have coordination.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yahoo. Let's kick some ass.&quot; He'd just entered a
wholly new dimension of exuberance. &quot;Shit fire and save your matches; fuck
a duck and see what hatches.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My sentiments precisely. I started scrolling up DNI's</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>portfolio of
high-tech securities, looking for the biggies. If things went as planned, our
screwing of Matsuo Noda was definitely going to be memorable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Jim Bob was chortling quietly to himself as he punched up
more numbers, moving on to bilk options traders on the AMEX.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matthew, you'd better finish explaining what you're up
to.&quot; Tam was standing behind me, her hand gripping my shoulder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, we have to do this fast. Switch a beat on Noda,
break his rhythm. Just trust me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My favorite word.&quot; She didn't move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now&quot;—I pointed to a column of green numbers on the
left-hand side of the screen—&quot;are those the percentage holdings DNI
has?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Looks correct.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were about what I remembered. DNI's positions varied
from around fifty percent to the low sixties.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay.&quot; I turned to face her. &quot;Which of these
do you want to knock out first? There may not be time to torpedo them
all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; She was frowning, but I
could tell the idea had appeal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Set dynamite under them. Just blow them sky-high.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Using an obscure corporate anti-takeover tactic not
many people know about yet. Jim Bob's right. We're going to make history.
Nobody's ever done this on the scale you're about to witness. Just pick the
stocks you want detonated first, but please hurry.&quot; I shoved a pen and
paper at her, then turned to watch Jim Bob, now dancing around with a phone in
his ear, still buying calls on the old DNI portfolio. &quot;How're we doing
over there, chief?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't want to push March too hard, tip off the market,
so I'm picking up some Junes too.&quot; He yelled my way, &quot;We're going
long, baby.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jim Bob, I was just wondering. Don't you think you
ought to hedge a little, just in case? Maybe buy a few puts to cover the
downside?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;With the kind of volatility I'm about to goose into
this market? You're starting to sound like some pussy, Walton. Get naked, go
native. Only way to fly.&quot; He did a twirl, then a kick. &quot;Just buckle
in, dude, cause I'm gonna take that Jap money and pump my underlying stocks
right into orbit. This play's a lock, taking money from a baby.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I wasn't blessed with your brand of raw courage,
Jim Bob. So what do you say I do a little hedging for you? We'll be partners.
I'll cover the downside with my own money, assuming I've got any left. I'll buy
a few puts, and then if these stock prices just decide to go crazy and crash,
we can still sell at the current quotes. Protect ourselves if things head south
for some reason.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Suit yourself. But that's the best way I can think of
to piss away what little 'haircut' you've got left.&quot; He was grinning
again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Guess I'm a masochist. What can I tell you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While my new &quot;partner&quot; was laying the groundwork
for his scam, loading up on options to buy stocks at today's prices just before
he turned around and shoved enough Japanese money into the market to send them
sky-high, I did the opposite. I got on the phone to various brokers, including
a currently jubilant Sam Kline, and started buying &quot;at the money&quot;
puts in Amy's name.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jim Bob was betting the market would head up, buying calls; I
was betting it would go down, buying puts. I was laying a wager with anybody in
America who would agree, for my front money, to buy a stock from me at today's
quotes anytime through mid-March, even if the real price had since dropped to zilch.
Which I fully intended to make happen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Insider trading? Well . . . yes. You see, I was literally the
only man on earth who actually knew what the stock market was going to do next,
after DNI started buying more of those stocks I'd planted with land mines. But
I was a driven man just then. Maybe I'd go to jail eventually, but by God Amy
would still make college.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Amy. What was she doing today? I wondered. This was, what?
Tuesday? So she must be back at school, probably thinking about lunch.
Strawberry yogurt and a bar of Tiger's Milk &quot;health&quot; candy. God, I
loved that little dark-haired prize more than life itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where were we headed, she and I? Was I going to learn to let
go? Maybe that wasn't going to be the problem, I thought, at least for her.
Face it, I was about to become a fixture, just a stuffy impediment to nature's
raging hormones. She'd already started rehearsing feminine wiles on me,
practicing that coy, downcast glance that didn't quite break subliminal eye
contact. Where did she learn stuff like that? And she almost had it down cold.
Next it'll probably be eye shadow and colored bras.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Damn. This Christmas was going to be my last real chance to
get to know her, to bore her silly with all my eminently ignorable fatherly
advice. And I blew it. That in itself was enough to make me want to deep-six
Matsuo Noda forever, the bastard. The money I fully planned to recoup; her
thirteenth Christmas was gone forever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With which somber thought, I returned to buying puts. By the
time I'd finished, Tam had her &quot;death wish&quot; list ready. And Jim Bob
was just wrapping up his new program of call-option acquisition. Now for phase
two.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I strolled over to his monitor, carrying her paper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jim Bob, these might be a good place to start.&quot; I
tossed the sheet down beside his keyboard. &quot;Why not just set up a lot of
buy orders to hit the market tomorrow at the opening? Doing it all at once
should drive the prices straight up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right.&quot; He leaned back, twitching. &quot;Wonder
how much buying it'll take?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, why not play it safe? Use the computer and just
boost DNI's high-tech portfolio another . . . oh, five percent, straight across
the board. Every issue. Program it and let her rip. You've already got Tam's
sell setup. All you have to do is turn it around.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sounds good to me.&quot; Now he was swaying to and fro,
humming tonelessly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then let's get rolling. You hit AMEX and the Big Board;
Tam and I'll see if we can't drop orders for a few blocks on Jeffries, the
off-exchange network. We have to make waves at the opening bell tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hear you talkin'. These issues gotta look like major
movers.&quot; He was beaming from ear to ear as he revolved shakily back to his
terminal. &quot;Damn if I don't jus' love screwing the market.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We went to work, and for the next half hour we transmitted
buy orders to the farthest reaches of the globe. Once they were posted, it
didn't matter when they'd be executed. Even if Noda killed us, a hand from the
grave would come back and destroy him. The time bomb I'd set would blow the
minute the SEC tallied up DNI's new holdings. There were about to be a lot of
rich, happy workers in this Land of the Free. But the one man certain not to be
among their number was Matsuo Noda. Speaking of which . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton, would you kindly explain what you are
doing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I froze, realizing he was standing directly behind my chair.
How long had he been there? I'd been too absorbed to pay attention. Stupid,
Walton, extremely stupid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell you the truth, Noda-san.&quot; I wheeled around
and looked him in the eye, shielding the screen. &quot;Sometimes you have to
make the best of things. Discretion's the better part of valor, so we’re
told.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm familiar with the expression.&quot; He appeared
less than convinced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who knows? Maybe Nipponica is the way to go.&quot; We
needed time, just a little more time. &quot;In any case I'm a firm believer in
riding the horse the direction it's going. So I persuaded Jim Bob to buy a few
options for me. Trouble is, the guy's a little tentative on reality just
now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Decidedly.&quot; He glanced over at our mutual friend,
now typing away obliviously, then turned and moved on toward the water cooler
next to my office. Did he believe me? Maybe he actually thought we would just
roll over and give up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or possibly Noda was in that unconscious mind-state that goes
along with real mastery in swordsmanship. When a Zen archer discharges an
arrow, his concentration must never be on that shaft. It must be on nothing.
And the same is true with swordsmanship. Your mind must be in its natural
state, empty of distractions. So if Noda allowed himself to focus on the small
stuff right now, he'd forfeit his &quot;no mind&quot; edge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, we were about through anyway. The only thing left was
to keep him occupied just long enough for Jim Bob to finish sending out the
last of our buys.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The sword was a masterful idea, Noda-san.&quot; I got
up and walked over to join him. &quot;How'd you manage it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton, what exactly do you know about the Emperor
Antoku's Imperial Sword?&quot; He sipped from a plastic cup, eyes squinting
behind his rimless specs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Probably more than I should.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>'Then you will understand its recovery is a turning point in
the history of Japan.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I looked at him and realized he believed it. Actually
believed it. Matsuo Noda had become a legend in his own mind. Why tamper with
perfection?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have to admit, too, the idea of using our international
bank cover to gobble up America's blue chips incognito was a stroke of genius.
Congratulations. You're about to scare MITI and the rest of Japan half to
death. Not to mention the world. With DNI heading up the management, who knows
what could happen? You can probably write your own ticket back home after
this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your friend Dr. Henderson's young colleague was
invaluable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alas, poor Jim Bob. Did that mean he wasn't going to live
long enough to spend the new fortune he thought he was about to make? Maybe
Noda was planning to do half of my work for me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I guess a few of those phone taps you like so much led
you straight to him, right? You were probably at least a day ahead of
everything we did.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good intelligence is vital to any successful endeavor,
Mr. Walton. You should remember that from Sun Tzu's classic Art of War.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The man was right on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All these dummy corporations.&quot; I was still running
the stall. &quot;A little stock bought by each one, the SEC will never suspect.
You just roll trades worldwide, till—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As long as necessary.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who knows you're doing this?&quot; Was it possible some
rogue financier such as Noda really could pull a fast one on the whole world,
use Japanese institutional money for whatever he pleased? &quot;Have you cleared
this with the fund managers . . . ?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It was not necessary, Mr. Walton. I have long since
earned the trust of my colleagues.&quot; Again he had a weird look in his eye.
Matsuo Noda, I realized, was currently operating from a distant planet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Needless to say, our dialogue hadn't done a lot to calm my
nervous system. The obvious solution to Noda's secrecy requirements didn't
include a lengthy life span for a lot of loudmouthed gaijin. Time to wrap up
the stock market games and get back to swordsmanship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;At this point there's only one problem left, but I
suppose</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>you've
already thought of it too. If word of this anonymous takeover breaks too soon,
the exchanges might just decide to shut down trading and stop you. Which means
we're all a threat to you at this point.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stood unmoving. &quot;That matter will be addressed
presently.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How soon, I wondered, was &quot;presently&quot;?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But haven't you forgotten somebody? Bill Henderson. The
man's no fool. The minute he figures out your play, which he surely will, he's
going to start blowing word all over the newspapers. You'll never get away with
this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda smiled lightly. &quot;It would be helpful if he were
here now. Perhaps you could be good enough to arrange for it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So with Matsuo Noda standing over me, Uzi next to my head, I
called Henderson on my speakerphone. He picked up after eight rings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bill. Getting rich?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Walton, what time is it? Goddam, you woke me up.&quot;
He yawned into the receiver. &quot;Jesus, I feel like hell. What's going on?
Everything still looking okay?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Couldn't be better. Quite a party around here. Want to
come back down and help us celebrate?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well . . . what the . . . ! It's after eleven already.
Hey, let me check out the market first. Be down there in a little.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I looked up as Noda fingered his Uzi. &quot;Just come on over
now. Don't putz around with the market. We could use the company. And Bill . .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This shindig's BYOB. So how about picking up a fifth of
Scotch? That way we can all get into the spirit of things here on the eleventh
floor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Walton, that's a hell of a—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know bringing your own booze is not your style. But
why don't you check in with Eddie, the security chief downstairs? He always
keeps me a bottle of Suntory there in the utility room. See him about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That Japanese crap. Matt, what are you talking about?
You know I hate—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just ask for Eddie, Bill.&quot; I cut him off.
&quot;Tell him Matthew Walton wants his black label Japanese juice sent up here
immediately. Understand?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I hung up before Henderson could say anything more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Such as tell
me we both knew there was no such thing as &quot;black label&quot; Suntory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Guess he'll be here shortly.&quot; I turned back to
Noda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He should be here in no time at all, Mr. Walton. Two of
my guards have been posted outside his building since he returned there
yesterday. For his own safety. They will bring him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With that chilling bit of news Matsuo Noda proceeded to yank
out the phone cord, then head back to his office. The Art of War. You leave
nothing to chance. In fact his two sumo heavies were now standing outside my
office, keeping a close eye on us. Guess he no longer had full confidence in
Jim Bob.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, did you catch what just happened?&quot; I'd walked
back over to the terminals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I did.&quot; She was staring into space.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Henderson was our best hope to get out of here alive.
He has a suspicious mind the equal of Sherlock Holmes's. But now...&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, what's he going to do to us all?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't think it'll be pretty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then . . .&quot; She'd turned and was staring at the
security entrance, wearing a quizzical expression.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I wheeled around to look too, and at first I thought I might
have been hallucinating. A female figure was emerging through the doors,
wearing an outfit whose style I couldn't quite place. Maybe it was one of those
bulky creations such as Yohji Yamamoto or some other avant-garde Japanese
designer might dream up, but it didn't resemble anything I'd ever seen before.
Silk like a kimono, yet with a flowing quality. Ancient almost.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then I had a vision, just offbeat enough to fit. An ink
illustration out of the The Tale of Genji flashed before my eyes, and I
realized I was seeing a <i>hakama</i>, something that hadn't been around the
streets of Japan for roughly eight hundred years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The woman in it was wearing peculiar makeup, not punk, though
it might have been. It was pale, like the delicate ink shadings on a Heian hand
scroll. She looked for all the world like a court lady of ages past; she'd have
fit right in at some 1185 Heian linked-verse soiree. Old Kyoto come to life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Is this the latest neo-New Wave? What in good Christ . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The only uncoordinated touch was the handbag, leather and
starkly modern, with a lock attached.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jim Bob gave her a glazed stare as she moved right past him,
headed for us. The sumo pair was bowing to the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton, where is the silver case?&quot; She'd
walked straight up to us and now was just standing there, awaiting an answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mori-san, that silver box is long gone, thanks to
Noda.&quot; I suddenly felt as if we'd just dropped out of the twentieth
century and back into the twelfth. Time warp. &quot;Let me tell you something.
It was like the apple in the Garden of Eden: bite into it and out would spew
the knowledge of good and evil. Better to forget the whole thing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You don't know anything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Definite point. We've just discovered there was a heck
of a lot we didn't know.&quot; I thumbed toward Noda's office. &quot;Including
the scope of Dai Nippon's impressive new investment program.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She ignored that response entirely as she whirled on Tam, her
voice increasingly strident. &quot;Dr. Richardson, you have betrayed His
Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mori-san, you and everybody who's helping Noda are the
ones who've done the betraying.&quot; Tam stared her in the eye, daggers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Even though you are Fujiwara, you still let him
continue,&quot; Mori pressed on, oblivious. &quot;His scheme to manipulate the
Emperor, to undermine MITI—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's got nothing to do with—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is the duty of a Fujiwara to protect His
Majesty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Speaking of His Majesty,&quot; I cut in, &quot;how much
did you have to do with Noda's fake sword? Guess that 'protected' the Emperor
too. Nothing like being handed a new lease on divinity.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The sword was to be his gift to me.&quot; She said it
hesitantly. &quot;To restore—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps we can clarify what it's really intended to
restore, Mori-san,&quot; I interrupted again. 'The shogunate, with Noda
as—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She turned on me. &quot;And you helped him too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You and Asano-san stole the only thing I could have
used to stop him. The contents of that silver case. And then this operation.
After I'd tried to warn you both.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mori-san, could be we're all acting under certain
misunderstandings here today. For starters, buying up every American blue chip
issue in sight was not exactly our idea.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stared at me for a second, disbelieving. &quot;But that
is precisely what you are doing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Think again.&quot; I pointed toward Noda's office.
&quot;That's his game. Helped along by that sharpshooter over at the
console.&quot; I waved to Jim Bob, who toasted us with his champagne glass,
still too zonked on uppers to comprehend the revised ground rules. &quot;Maybe
you'd like to run through it with them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She seemed to notice him for the first time. &quot;Who is
that person?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Noda's new hired gun. We've been retired. Without even
so much as a gold watch.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He is the one responsible?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's good, tell you that. Fooled us all.&quot; I
settled onto the office couch. &quot;Noda's got him and this supercomputer.
Looks like good-bye America.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Noda's office door, incidentally, was still firmly closed, so
presumably he wasn't yet aware of Mori's arrival. Were we about to see history
replayed before our very eyes, that fateful battle of Dan-no-ura staged all over
again, eight hundred years later, as a loyal retainer of the emperor fought to
thwart the armed takeover of a would-be shogun? Wonder who was going to win
this time around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Walton, this must be stopped.&quot; She was turning
the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>key on her
new leather handbag, unlocking it. &quot;I also insist you return your copy of
the contents of that case. Having that is the only way I can—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mori-san, not so long ago the contents of that silver
box were very dear to our hearts, which is one reason we took the precaution of
storing a facsimile on the hard-disk memory of the mainframe here. Now, there
are about ten zillion files in that computer, so all you have to do is figure
out what file name we used and you can just run off all the copies you
want.&quot; I got up and faced her. &quot;At the moment, though, there're more
pressing worries.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You are playing with fire, Mr. Walton.&quot; She
glanced at the computer room down at the other end of the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No kidding. This is a tough game we've got going. Maybe
you'd like to get an update from the other team too, Noda and his new
crony.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you saying he is the one?&quot; She was pointing
toward Jim Bob, who was now winding up the last dispatch of our new buy orders.
I noticed it was the third time she had inquired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't take our say-so for it. Go ask him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without a word she spun around, leaving a cloud of exquisite
floral perfume in her wake. Tell the truth, I rather liked the designer outfit,
what you might call a real classic. What I didn't care for all that much were
the vibes. Very, very ominous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she strode toward Jim Bob, he watched her with an
unfocused gaze. He apparently assumed it was all some costume-party gag.
Definitely a major mistake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I am Akira Mori.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Probably by then he no longer knew what he was seeing. He
revolved around, adjusted the Uzi leaning against the console, and extended his
paw.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Pleased to make your acquaintance. Jim Bob McClinton.
You work for Mr. Noda?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In a manner of speaking.&quot; She ignored the
proffered handshake. &quot;Is it true you are now in his employ?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was. At the moment, though, I'm taking care of
myself, American-style, if you want to know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Whatever you are doing, I hereby order you to terminate
all activities in this office. Immediately.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jim Bob just stared at her, not quite sure his brain wasn't
playing more tricks. &quot;Well, now, I'd normally like to oblige a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>pretty lady
like yourself, but I'm afraid I just don't have any intention of doing
that.&quot; He grinned, eyes flashing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you telling me you refuse?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You hear real good.&quot; He reached down for the Uzi,
and his bloodshot eyes began to blink. &quot;Far as that goes, where I come
from we're not used to takin' orders from cute little twats. So the best thing
for you to do would be to shake your ass out of my way and mind your own
business. Or maybe go talk things over with Noda.&quot; He thumbed toward the
office. &quot;In there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was opening her handbag, reaching inside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jim Bob, I was wanting to yell, this woman is neither
&quot;cute&quot; nor &quot;little.&quot; Above all, she is definitely not a
&quot;twat.&quot; You are now face-to-face with a world heavyweight
ball-breaker. Who may be about to take that Uzi you're so proud of and tie it
around your scrofulous neck. This game is way over your head. Can't you see
where it's headed?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, what's she doing?&quot; Tam bolted forward. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sad to say, everybody was too late, including Henderson. By
probably no more than a second or so. I watched Jim Bob swing around his
automatic . . . and then the lights went out. We heard the dull thunk of a
silencer, followed by another, and next the sound of a chair crashing backward,
an Uzi clattering across the floor. It was indeed Dan-no-ura all over again,
only this time the shogun's forces had just taken the first hit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But at least Henderson must have eluded Noda's gorillas.
How'd he do it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whatever had happened, he'd gotten the message. Suntory
black. He'd had Eddie yank the master switch for the eleventh floor. He
&quot;blacked out&quot; Dai Nippon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For what good it did. Not much, as things transpired. He'd
only cut the overheads. The computer must have had its own backup power, some
circuit that didn't run through the main utility room. The office was now
eerily illuminated by CRT screens, still buying blue chips. As usual, Noda had
prepared for all eventualities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Gingerly we inched out onto the floor. Jim Bob was sprawled
beside his console in a spreading pool of blood. Maybe he was still alive.
Maybe not. Tam reached down to check the pulse at his neck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's gone.&quot; She looked up, stunned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Who was next? More to the point, where the hell was Mori?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then we saw her, moving like a ghostly figure in a <i>No </i>play,
gliding through the bizarre lime-colored light of the terminals. We watched as
she disappeared into Noda's office, trailed by the two dumbstruck guards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What a standoff, I reflected fleetingly. The would-be shogun
versus the Emperor's number one fan. This time, though, the Imperial side is
hopping mad and loaded for bear. Wonder who'll . . . ?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was, however, something more important to think about.
The next few seconds could turn everything around. This was hardly the time for
historical meditations. With deliberate haste we might even live long enough
for some history of our own later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the dim glow of the screens Tam grabbed Jim Bob's Uzi, and
we both dived for Noda's office. The door, happily, had just slammed shut.
Since it was the kind that opened out, all we had to do was shove a desk
against it and they were contained.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now, how much time did we have?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The mainframe.&quot; She was staring through the green
shadows toward the glassed-in room that contained the massive NEC.
&quot;Matthew, we've got to shut it down somehow. That's the only way left to
stop him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is there an on-off switch?&quot; Who knew how you went
about disconnecting a twenty-million-dollar supercomputer?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're about to find out.&quot; She led the way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The entry door was glass, half-inch, and locked. Beyond it
stood the string of six-foot-high modules, off-white and octagonal, lined up
like squat soldiers on flooring elevated about six inches above that outside.
The nerve center of Noda's empire rested there on its platform, silent and
secure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tam, pass me that thing.&quot; I reached for the Uzi,
turned it around, and rammed the steel butt against the glass. Then again. It
just bounced off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Harder.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, but stand away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I hauled back and swing at it with all my might. With a
sickening crunch the glass shattered inward, spewing shards across the icy
tiles inside. An alarm went off somewhere out on the floor, but we just ignored
it. After I'd punched away a few hanging pieces, we stepped in and up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I handed back the Uzi. Now what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's freezing in here.&quot; She shivered from the
cold, then pointed down. &quot;You know, all the wiring must be underneath this
raised floor. There's no way to even know where the power conduit is, let alone
reach it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, guess we'll just have to start ripping . .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My heart skipped a beat. As my eyes adjusted to the dim
light, I finally noticed what I should have seen immediately. Lying atop the
big computation module was a thin, four-foot- long bundle, swathed in silk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So there's where he decided to put it—in the one room that
would always be locked. Or maybe he thought it should be kept in the most
powerful location on the premises.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I reached up and retrieved it, then pulled away the silk. The
blade had just been freshly oiled, and it literally glistened in the dim light.
It was every bit as razor-sharp as the day it had been consecrated eight
hundred years ago at the zenith of samurai metallurgy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Guess Noda knew a prize when he saw it. And this <i>katana </i>was
definitely a one-of-a-kind piece—an Old Sword, <i>koto</i>, from the Sanjo
branch of the Yamashiro school of swordsmiths, late Heian. Signed by Munechika,
said to have fashioned samurai swords for the Shogun Minamoto Yoritomo himself,
the man who destroyed the Imperial forces at Dan-no-ura. No wonder Noda had
treated it with special reverence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Welcome.&quot; I held it up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why do you suppose he put it in here?&quot; She was
admiring it too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, I think I understand. But it's the kind of
thing that can't be explained in words.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, at least you've got it back again. Samson's hair.
Are you pleased?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe Noda was trying to tell me something. Send a
message. But now I'm going to send one back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you really think . . . ?&quot; She was already ahead
of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Guess we're about to find out.&quot; I bowed to the
blade ritually, then to the NEC's head-high main processor. &quot;From the
first shogun to the last.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This, I muttered silently, is for Amy. Her answer, Noda- san.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The great masters of swordsmanship all will tell you
something very ironic. If you train for years and years, all your</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>moves
eventually become instinctive; you literally no longer &quot;know&quot; what
you are doing. You become oblivious of your mind, as unknowing, consciously, of
technique as the day you started. Thus the greatest masters and the rankest
beginners actually share something very similar. Both are totally unaware of
technique.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was I closer to the mindless beginner or the &quot;no
mind&quot; master? Friends, that's one confession you'll need medieval torture
to extract.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I will, however, admit to thinking about which stroke to use.
There are several that might have done the job. Of them all, though, the <i>kesa</i>
seemed best for some reason. It slices diagonally, from the left shoulder down
and across to the right, and a swordsman pure in spirit can literally bisect a
man, slice him right in half.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the blade sang through the cold and struck with a ring
true as a bell, I felt nothing, thought nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The hexagonal computation unit standing in front of us wasn't
halved, not even close, but it was severely disoriented. I felt a small tingle
in my fingertips as the sword sailed through the outer steel casing and severed
its first layer of silicon neurons, sending forth a shower of sparks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It wasn't dead, but then the sword had some backup. There is
a long tradition in Japanese culture of cooperation, support from others. For
example, in <i>seppuku</i>, the ritual disembowelment sometimes called <i>hara-kiri</i>,
there is always a second participant who stands behind you and ceremonially
lops off your head as your body topples forward. It is an honored assignment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My action may have been satisfying symbolically, but it
wouldn't do the job alone. Fortunately it didn't have to. There was one simple
way to disengage Noda's electronic brain, now and forever. Tam didn't even
hesitate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For a second there it could have been the Fourth of July. An
Uzi blasting away in the dark is a marvel. I watched spellbound as she emptied
about twenty rounds into the processor bank as well as into everything else in
sight, continuing until smoke started to pour out of the flooring below,
followed by the crackle of electrical shorting. Then several storage modules
began to arc, their high voltage mating in midair. In moments Noda's NEC
supercomputer was transformed into a shorting, sputtering junk heap.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After that, electrical fires erupted down below, and the
linoleum squares beneath our feet proceeded to heat and buckle. Next, something
flashed somewhere in the dark, and a stack of computer printouts lying next to
the door burst into flame.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Originally I'd planned to retrieve the blade, but then I
reflected a second and decided just to leave it. The sword in the
supercomputer. A six-figure gesture, maybe, but one worth every penny in
satisfaction. Noda would definitely understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By the time we made our way back through the shattered glass
doorway, picking a path among the splinters, the fire was already spreading to
the main office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's get out of here.&quot; Tam was still grasping the
Uzi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not so fast.&quot; I reached for the grip. &quot;You
don't get to have all the fun. How do you operate this thing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just pull there.&quot; She pointed, then raised the
muzzle. &quot;Careful. You might need that foot someday.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I lifted it up and it coughed a burst of flame. The water
cooler outside my office exploded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Uh, I think you have to be Chuck Norris to do it like
that. On a scale of one to ten, that round scores down in the fractions. Better
aim.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Spoilsport.&quot; But I did. I took critical bead on a
leering green monitor, squeezed, and felt a light kick from the metal stock.
Out blinked one of the dying monster's eyes. Then I methodically took out half
a dozen more workstations, just for the hell of it. Automatic weapons fire can
be great therapy. Not to mention fun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay for a beginner . . . Matt!&quot; She was pointing
at the desk of Noda's secretary. A phone light had just flashed on. &quot;He's
calling in reinforcements.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Time to make our not-so-graceful exit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bring the automatic.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've got it . . . and, uh, I'm a little embarrassed
to ask you for money, but would you mind grabbing your purse. We may need
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're now broke, right?&quot; She dashed for her
office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So we're told.&quot; I was wrapping the Uzi in some
computer printouts that hadn't yet caught fire. The place was really starting
to blaze, thanks to all the paper. Smoke everywhere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While she was coming back, I decided to go over and kick</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>the desk
away from Noda's door. Sure it was a risk, but we couldn't let him burn to
death. Or Mori. Besides, we were home free. With the NEC supercomputer blown to
pieces, as well as Jim Bob, there was absolutely no way Noda could cancel that
stack of buy orders we'd seeded all around the globe. Nothing could stop the
bomb.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As we made our way through security, we saw Mori coming out
of the office, choking through the smoke and looking crazed as ever. Apparently
the battle of Dan-no-ura, twentieth-century style, was still raging. Then Noda
appeared in the doorway behind her and just stood there surveying the blazing
ruins of his empire. With his customary discipline, he appeared totally
unperturbed by it all. Not her, though. She lunged for the remains of the
computer room, now billowing smoke and tongues of fire. The last thing on her
mind, apparently, was us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which was just as well, because the second we hit the hallway
we heard the elevator chime. It had to be Noda's backup forces. Without a word
we both ducked for the stairwell, and as the metal door slammed behind us,
Tanaka and a host of armed DNI security guards poured off the elevator like
gangbusters. Turns out there'd been a small army poised downstairs just in
case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They could have the place, what was left of it. My last
memory of that office was a raging torrent of smoke and flame. Nothing
remained. This had to be the grand finale for Dai Nippon and Matsuo Noda. The
end. <i>Finis</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When we emerged into the lobby calmly as we could muster,
fire engines were racing up outside, cops were crowded around the elevators,
and Eddie was so frantic yelling about the holocaust up on eleven he didn't
even bother to say hello. We searched in vain for Henderson as we worked our
way through the milling throng, headed for the pay phone in the corner. Bill
had to be somewhere; nobody else would have blacked out the DNI offices.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My first thought, though, was that we needed to make tracks.
The brouhaha to come would best be handled from the safety of a foreign shore.
Fortunately in my pocket was just enough change for one call, and as luck would
have it, our man was in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sure, Matt, no problem. But this is damned
sudden.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right now, Patrick. And hurry. Could be the perfect
moment for an extended vacation. How about just sending the car around? Over on
Third, near—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That Japanese place you told me you work for?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Worked for, Patrick. No more. Just got laid off.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hell, I know where they are. It's all over the tube.
I'm sitting here right now watching Jack O'Donnell blow his stack at a press
briefing down in D.C. Wish you could see the guy. It's live on CNN. Is this
thing for real? What was that Dai Nippon outfit trying to do? Buy up
every—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

color:windowtext'>&quot;Patrick.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fill you in on all the details over a drink someday.
Right now, though, we could really use Charlie and the car ASAP. We'll be
waiting outside.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I looked at the smoke-smeared woman standing beside me.
&quot;Truthfully, I'm hoping for some company.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam smiled, then reached out and took my hand. Not a word
about &quot;strictly business.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, Matt, Charlie just walked in. I'll send him
straight on over.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks a million. Owe you a big one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As we moved on out through the revolving doors, we finally
spotted Henderson, wearing his gray topcoat and mingled in among the crowd on
the sidewalk. The lowest of low profiles. For a second I almost didn't
recognize the man. He looked a wreck, standing there shading his eyes and
squinting up. Then I followed his gaze and realized smoke was pouring out of
the windows on eleven. Seems we'd demolished a little exterior plate glass,
too, along with everything else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bill.&quot; I signaled. &quot;Over here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Walton, thank God.&quot; He waved and pushed our way.
&quot;I was worried stiff you two might still be up there. What in hell
happened? Did you just blow up—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Long story. There was a small war, a new one and an old
one. But how'd you get here? Noda said he was having you</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> watched. A couple of—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah, I saw those two apes. They were in my lobby in
handcuffs, being grilled by New York's Finest when I came through. Our doorman
figured they were casing us for a robbery and called the cops. What's Noda
think—I live in a fucking tent? I pay for top security, friend. The best.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Anyway, nice work with the lights. Much appreciated.
The bad news is, you might want to get out of town for a while. Maybe go skiing
someplace. The whole thing fell apart. Noda just brought in a whole new load of
funding.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hell, I figured that out the minute I saw the Times
lying there outside my door. Only one place the market could be getting this
kind of dough. Tokyo pension funds. So I went back in and called Jack.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You made the right move, tipping him off.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe he can get trading shut down. Stop it
somehow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We stopped it ourselves,&quot; Tam interjected, then
indicated the paper bundle in her hands, black metal stock protruding out of
one corner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;God Almighty.&quot; He stared around at the policemen
racing by, walkie-talkies chattering. &quot;Where's Jim Bob? I got a good mind
to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your hotshot screwed us, Bill. Noda got to him and
bought him off.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I figured that out too. Little fucker.&quot; He
grimaced. &quot;Guess I trained him too well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He didn't deserve his payoff. Somebody'd better hustle
a medic up there fast.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let them take care of it.&quot; He thumbed at the
firemen piling off their trucks, then bent over and pecked Tam on the cheek.
&quot;Well, Professor, it's been short and sweet. Keep 'em honest.&quot; He
reached for my hand. &quot;Walton, you know how I hate to travel on short
notice, but considering the situation . . . St. Moritz might be nice for a
while.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Drink some Pear William for us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Will do. Best of luck.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Same to you.&quot; I watched him flip up the collar on
his coat as he turned. &quot;Oh, by the way, Bill, one last thing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah?&quot; He glanced back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Want a little insider information?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Wouldn't dream of listening.&quot; He returned like a
shot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Might not be a bad idea to short every high-tech stock
DNI currently holds. There's a finite possibility all hell's going to break
loose at the opening tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's the story?&quot; He was all ears.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tam turned to me. &quot;Are you finally going to explain what
that scam with Jim Bob was all about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, now there's some time. What I did was sucker him
into posting buy orders for an additional five percent of every company on your
kill list.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm well aware of that.&quot; She just continued to
stare.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Which means that when the SEC reports those holdings,
it'll trigger the new provisions their majority stockholder— with whose power
of attorney I acted with full legal authority—voted last week.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Which was?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's a little like what's being called a 'tin parachute'
these days, the latest twist on the antitakeover 'poison pill.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Isn't that where managements have their boards vote
that a hostile buyout will trigger big disbursements of a company's assets to
the rank and file? What's that got to do with . . . ?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the play. Great takeover defense, by the
way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But Noda had already taken those companies over.&quot;
She frowned, puzzling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right. Obviously, nobody's supposed to institute one <i>after
</i>a takeover, but that's what Dai Nippon voted to do last Wednesday and
Thursday for every company it owns. The way it's set up now, if the majority
stockholder in any of those companies, which just happens to be DNI, acquires
another four percent or more, all that stockholder's stock is automatically
disbursed to the employees.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just like that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fully legal. Like a 'tin parachute.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what will . . . ?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me finish. In my version there're some strings
attached. The money can't be used to just go out and buy Toyotas. I arranged it
so that all the stock will be held in escrow for ten years and used as
collateral for loans specially earmarked to finance expansion and R and D. In
other words the employees are about to become those companies' new bank
partner.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What in holy hell are you talking about?&quot;
Henderson appeared to have just entered shock. His bloodshot eyes were like
saucers. &quot;Noda's piece of those high-tech outfits is just going to be
given to the troops, then locked up as security for new financing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bill, try and think of it as a different kind of 'restructuring,'
that grand new corporate scam. But instead of the standard rip-off where
managers entrench themselves by loading up a company with debt and bribing
their shareholders with the money, I turned the whole thing upside down. Gave
the control of those companies to their workers, who'll now have a stake in
dividends and profits.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Walton, you idiot. Stock prices for those outfits are
going to nosedive the second news of this hits the Street. It'll scare the
institutions shitless. I've never heard anything so crazy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who knows what'll happen? Let the 'supply side'
economists try and figure it out. My guess is we're about to find out if
anybody here still believes in the working man. In any case it can't make
things worse, and it should be great fun to watch. At least American industry
is about to be owned by the people who punch the time clocks. Maybe working for
ourselves instead of investment bankers will help things get rolling
again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't believe you did this.&quot; Tam fell against me
laughing. &quot;Do you realize what it really means? Noda's totally destroyed.
He'll have to sell off that new portfolio of blue chips just to have enough
profit to cover the claims of his original Eight-Hundred-Year-Fund investors.
After this, no Japanese money manager is going to give him a yen. He's
history.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Bushido</i>. When you break the rules, things like
that can happen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jesus, I'm not going to screw around short selling. I'm
just gonna load up on puts before the opening tomorrow. You oughta do the same,
Walton. When the Street gets wind of this and all those stocks crater, you
could clear millions.&quot; Bill headed briskly up the avenue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stay well.&quot; We watched him disappear into the
crowd, then started searching for Charlie Morgan and the car.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Incidentally, the recipient of that phone call wasn't really
named Patrick. Since there are laws about smuggling firearms in and out of
countries, and we damned well were going to take along the Uzi, it seems only
right to give him a pseudonym. His charter outfit, which works out of that
hangar off to the side of the majors at Kennedy, keeps a Lear that can make the
Caribbean in one hop if it's not too full. He even picks you up in a limo, his
come-on for the carriage trade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>About ten minutes later we saw Charlie working the Rolls around
all the fire engines double-parked on Third and waving for us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good to see you again, Matt.&quot; He glanced back as
we settled in. &quot;Christ, you two look terrible. Were you up there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just left.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Must have been a hell of a fire from the looks of
it.&quot; He hit the gas and made a right turn. &quot;Where to? Straight down
Fifth to you</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;One quick stop first. Over on West
Seventy-eighth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The West Side? In this traffic? Come on, Matt. I still
haven't had lunch.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just cut through Central Park. Should be a snap.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While he and Tam waited outside the West Side &quot;Free
School, I went in to try and kidnap Amy. It wasn't easy. I finally explained to
Ms. Winters that my daughter's Christmas vacation had merely been delayed a
little this year, but better late than never. After some haggling, we struck a
deal on homework. Then, in a limo piled high with school books, class projects,
lunch boxes, and a black Israeli Uzi, we headed downtown.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dad, you've gone nuts.&quot; My only offspring was in
heaven.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honey, we're going to snorkel for two weeks solid.
Think you can stand the old man for that long?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can we have a Christmas tree? You promised.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll cut it myself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And a Christmas party too?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Might have to call it something else, but I suppose we
can give it a try. If you keep up on the homework.&quot; I looked at her,
failing as usual to understand the movements of her mind. &quot;Sweetie, why do
you want to throw a party? This is supposed to be a vacation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dad, really. Don't you remember that neat boy from
Sweden whose parents have that house across the bay? He was teaching me
windsurfing last summer. He's in junior year now, but if he's there, we've got
to have a party. Don't you understand?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Guess we'll have a party.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What can you do? Nobody said you're supposed to win them all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Bad news, or maybe it was good news, travels with amazing
speed in this day and age. The late edition of the Tuesday New York Post found
its way to the Caribbean on an evening flight, and since it took us a while to
get out of town, it actually reached the Virgin Islands shortly before we did.
However, since we flew directly into St. Croix instead of the main island of
St. Thomas, we missed the delivery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As it happened, though, an old acquaintance was passing the
house that night on a personal mission, and he was kind enough to drop off
Rupert Murdoch's Tuesday contribution to journalism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The time was around ten P.M. Amy was sound asleep, conked out
from twilight windsurfing, and Tam and I were working on a pitcher of planter's
punch by the pool when there came the sound of honking out front. I went in and
unlocked the entry, then peeked out to see who it was. The red, white, and blue
jeep belonged to none other than Artie Wilson, dressed to the nines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Walton, my man, you done gone and got yourself famous.&quot;
He grinned with delight, then threw a rolled-up newspaper toward the door.
&quot;Tole you it'd be yo' ass.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Artie, what in hell. Turn that thing off and come in
for a drink. Somebody I want you to meet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, late for a reception at that new place down the beach.
Think all them hot New York divorcees jus' come down here for nothing but
sunshine an' vitamin D? Gotta keep the tourists satisfied.&quot; He revved his
engine and began backing out of the drive. &quot;Tomorrow, maybe, Feds ain't
nailed yo' honkie butt by then.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With which enigmatic pronouncement he sped into the humid
night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I picked up the bundle, then snapped on the yard lights and
strolled back out where Tam was sitting, still wearing her pool robe. What was
Artie talking about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As I settled down beside her and unrolled the paper, staring
back at us from the front page were two very familiar faces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Off one of my book jackets,&quot; she said. &quot;I
never much cared for it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mine's from their photo morgue, during some takeover
circus.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Guess we should have been keeping closer tabs on the news.
Seems that Matsuo Noda, president of Dai Nippon, Int., had held a press
conference mid-afternoon Tuesday to refute all the misinformation being spread
by Senator Jack O'Donnell. As he claimed, it was actually two Americans, former
employees of DNI, who had been responsible for Dai Nippon's secret hostile
takeover of the U.S.'s largest corporations. He made this point to dispute
Senator O'Donnell's assertion that they had been the ones who'd stopped it.
(See photo, page 1.) He went on to apologize for what apparently had been a
severe communications mix-up within DNI, which brought about this unauthorized
action, and he was pleased to report he personally had taken steps to terminate
the buy-up this very morning, as of 11:53 A.M.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Run that whopper by Jack's subcommittee, Noda-san.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was more. Seems the body of an unidentified male—young,
Caucasian, and badly burned—had been recovered by firemen on the eleventh floor
of DNI's offices. Noda had no idea who this person was, perhaps a misfortunate
prowler. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Matt, look!&quot; She was pointing at a paragraph on
the lower half of the page.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There'd been a second casualty, although not as serious. The
well-known Japanese financial commentator Akira Mori had been borne,
unconscious, from the premises. Acute smoke inhalation. As of press time she
was in intensive care at Mt. Sinai Hospital.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We saw her come out of the office. It was pretty smoky
by then, but how could . . . ?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The answer followed. Firemen reportedly had discovered her in
the computer room near the mainframe's burned-out storage banks. Speculation
was she had been attempting to save the hard disks, the vital DNI files.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mori wasn't trying to save anything.&quot; Tam tossed
down the paper. &quot;She wanted to make sure all the disks were destroyed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>To protect
the Emperor from a scandal over Noda's sword hoax.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Another victim for the Imperial sword.&quot; I looked
up at the starry sky, a mosaic of silver and black as the Milky Way floated
above us. The night air was symphonic with the sound of crickets. &quot;How
many more?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she retrieved the <i>Post</i> and we finished the item.
After Noda's prepared statement there'd been a Q&amp;A—during which he
reaffirmed his intention to use all available means to block Senator
O'Donnell's subpoena of DNI's remaining records, an action he declared
confiscatory and groundless. Privileged information, etc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He did, however, manage to wrap things up on a forward-
looking note. Today's unfortunate, indeed tragic, accidental fire should be
understood as merely a momentary setback. Nothing that had happened would in
any way diminish his program of capital infusion and open-market acquisition in
America's high-tech sector. Wall Street need not worry; Senator O'Donnell's
&quot;harassment&quot; notwithstanding, Dai Nippon's money was here to stay. We
were now partners. His grand new alliance, Nipponica, would shape the world to
come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's what he thinks.&quot; She laughed. &quot;Wait
till he wakes up tomorrow and discovers he just donated all his high-tech
acquisitions to their employees. Don't think that fits the big strategy. One
thing, though, America's overpaid, golf-playing senior executives could have
some wild and woolly board meetings ahead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Life's full of surprises.&quot; I pulled her over and
slipped my arm around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And the biggest one for me, this week at least, has
been you.&quot; She turned and kissed me softly on the mouth, then again. My
heart skipped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whereupon she abruptly rose and dove headfirst into the pool.
Without her suit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Looked to be a second chance coming up this year, for us all.</span></p>

moving target, which means they must necessarily include an element of
forecasting. Inventing the world to come is always more an art than a science,

continuing. Sometimes, in fact, you look into the crystal ball and hope what
you see never happens. This fable is offered in that spirit.</span></p>
